3. Write a function to traverse a threaded binary tree in postorder. What are
the time and space requirements of your function?

5. Consider threading a binary tree using preorder threads rather than inorder
threads as in the text. Which of the traversals can be done without the use of a
stack? For those that can be performed without a stack, write a c++ function to
analyze its space complexity.

15. A complex valued matrix X is represented by a pair of matrices (A,B) where A and B contain real values. Write a program that computes the product of two
complex-value matrices (A,B) and (C,D), where (A,B) * (C,D) = (A + iB) * (C +
iD) = (AC - BD) + i(AD + BC). Determine the number of additions and
multiplications if the matrices are all n x n.

(i) n^(1.001) + nlogn = (theta)(n^(1.001))
