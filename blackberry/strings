Jonathan- In light of the drama that happened yesterday, I was thinking
about what wonderful friends I have, and how they've helped me become a much
better person- you most of all. So I wanted to write a letter to thank you
for helping me to become the person I am today. I'm certainly not perfect,
but I'm closer now than I ever was. You helped me to gain confidence in
myself. Because of you, I can say I'm beautiful and actually mean it, and I
can take a compliment. You have helped my faith grow- my faith in God, my
faith in people, and faith in myself. Even though we don't talk that much
since you went to college and became a flake, I still know that I can call
you and you'll listen to me (like when I get a stupid ticket) and that
you'll help me out with anything. I'm sorry that I didn't take the whole
not-dating thing as well as I'm sure we both hoped, but I hope that we can
forget about it and still be really good friends. You are the person that's
had the biggest influence for good in my life, and from things you've told
me in the past I've helped you out a little bit too. I was just afraid that
after we weren't dating anymore, we wouldn't be friends. I think I freaked
out and acted the wrong way, and I'm sorry about that. Even if there's not
the same kind of love there, I want you to know that I will always be your
friend.
Thank you also for helping me learn. I don't mean just things like chemistry
(although that really did help me out a lot), but things about life. I'm not
sure that I always treated you fairly or gave you the credit you deserved,
and I'm sure that I was probably a little too demanding and expected way too
much of you. As stupid as it sounds, I think that was because I didn't know
any better. I'm glad that you put up with it. You taught me about love and
friendship and how to deal with problems, and plenty of other things that I
can't put into words. You told me once that you loved me not in spite of my
faults, but because of them. Your unwavering faith in me was better than
anything else in the world, especially during the time when my dad left and
I needed it most.
I've learned a lot and grown up a lot since we've stopped dating. As much as
I hated it, I'm starting to see that it really was for the best. I'm glad
that you could see it a little more clearly than I. You are a really good
person. Thank you for being a good friend to me. Even if you make fun of me
all the time now. Anyways, you've probably heard enough from me. And you
probably won't read this email until a week from now, 'cause it's too long
to read on your phone. lol. I hope you have a good day!
Love Always,
Lehla
Are you alive?

How's it going?
I quit calling because you were always busy, but feel free to (please stop
being a flake and) call me sometime. I probably will have some stuff to tell
you, even if you don't have anything to say to me. Plus, I miss you. I
haven't talked to you in a week.

Re:
That sounds like fun, i have some good news.  I found a friend that goes to church here, and she's going to tell me how to get there.  And also, my Thursday class moved to Tuesday, so I can go to institute.  And I'm having a lot of fun, and I've determined that meghan likes me, at least I'm pretty sure, but nothing's happened yet.  How's school?
Re:

That's awesome about church!!! I can come get you any weekend that you want
to be baptized. I'll pick you up and take you back to school... you can even
bring some friends with you if you want.
Once again: how could anyone not like you? I've found that a ton of guys
around here like me... I told Mr. Gaffigan about it, and he says "that's
your burden to bear, sister." It was funny.
School's going pretty well. Aside from the fact that I've lost all desire to
do any work whatsoever. (and i haven't even finished applying to school,
much less gotten accepted!)
Exams are this week which sucks, but most of them don't matter. I need an A
in physics and in Gov to have an A for the semester when colleges look at
them, so hopefully that will go alright for me. I'm sure it will. I should
probably go to bed, but it was nice talking/texting/ emailing with you. You
can text me anytime so that I know you're still alive.

Thought you all might be interested in this vignette about Robert E. Lee I came across in a blog about Gettysburg. 
A Perspective on Robert E. Lee 
Reading over my post from last Sunday, I couldn't stop thinking about a spot from a History Channel documentary on the final month of the war and the impact Robert E. Lee had on the healing of the war's many wounds. Of course, no brief posting can adequately capture the essence of Lee or hope to summarize his person and character. Those who seek to rightfully challenge his post-war deification often underscore his turning a blind eye to the capturing and selling of free blacks during the Gettysburg Campaign. However, the History Channel's account of the former General's actions after the war certainly offers a different perspective. I have transcribed a portion of that documentary below. After reviewing it several times, I'm confident I have made no errors or omissions of the narration accompanying the description of Lee's actions one day after his surrender at Appomattox. However, any errors discovered would be strictly my own. Now from "April 1865: The Month That Saved America". (The History Channel, Copyright 2003)
"It's a warm spring Sunday at Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond. As the minister is about to present Holy Communion, a tall well-dressed black man sitting in the section reserved for African Americans unexpectedly advances to the communion rail; unexpectedly because this has never happened here before. 
The congregation freezes. Those who have been ready to go forward and kneel at the communion rail remain fixed in their pews. The minister stands in his place stunned and motionless. The black man slowly lowers his body, kneeling at the communion rail.
After what seems an interminable amount of time, an older white man rises. His hair snowy white, head up, and eyes proud, he walks quietly up the isle to the chancel rail. 
So with silent dignity and self-possession, the white man kneels down to take communion along the same rail with the black man.
Lee has said that he has rejoiced that slavery is dead. But this action indicates that those were not idle words meant to placate a Northern audience. Here among his people, he leads wordlessly through example. The other communicants slowly move forward to the altar with a mixture of reluctance and fear, hope and awkward expectation. In the end, America would defy the cruel chain of history besetting nations torn apart by Civil War."
I don't think there is anything I can add that speaks louder than his actions that day.
Respectfully,
Randy

Reminder: Reapply For Federal Student Aid
jonathan.plona@gmail.com
Federal Student Aid
FederalStudentAidPIN@cpsemail.ed.gov
NoReplyA@cpsemail.ed.gov
Dear JONATHAN,
This is to remind you that if you have not already applied for federal student aid for the 2007-2008 school year, you can do so now using the Renewal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on the Web at www.fafsa.ed.gov.
You may also use the Renewal FAFSA to apply for aid from other sources, such as your state or school.  Check important state deadlines at www.fafsa.ed.gov under the "Before Beginning a FAFSA" link.  Check with your school's financial aid office for information about school deadlines.
You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to complete your 2007-2008 Renewal FAFSA on the Web.
If you have forgotten your PIN, you can request a duplicate by going to www.pin.ed.gov and selecting "Request a Duplicate PIN."  You must also select how you want your PIN delivered to you, either by e-mail or U.S. postal mail.  If you select e-mail, you will receive your PIN by e-mail within 4 hours after requesting it.  If you select postal mail, you will receive your PIN by mail within 7-10 days after requesting it.
Remember, your PIN gives you access to your personal information on the Web and also allows you to sign student aid documents electronically.  To protect the confidentiality of your application data, you should never share your PIN with anyone, even if that person is helping you to complete your Renewal FAFSA on the Web.
If you have questions about your Renewal FAFSA, online help is available at www.fafsa.ed.gov.   You can also contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) and a customer service representative can assist you.
Thank You,

Dear all,
Next Saturday, Feb. 10, there will be a pep rally before the Ohio vs. Northern Illinois game.
 The pep rally is called "March to the MAC."
 Both teams will be recognized.
 The report time is 12:45.
 There will be a break before the men's game, so you will be fed pizza and pop!
 Also, one bonus point is offered for attendees.
 Please email me to commit. Also, so we'll know how much pizza to get.
What to wear for this game (and pep rally): This game is "Throwback Day."
 While I would love for us to be able to wear green and white striped rugbies to be authentic,
 we'll wear OUMB Black T-Shirts.
 (The OHIO ones, NOT the Bama ones).
 And blue jeans with sneakers.

Important Tax Information
jp354706@ohio.edu
Dean of Students Office
university.announcements@ohio.edu
Dear student,
I am writing to share with you important information about 
a tuition deduction applicable to federal income taxes 
reported for 2006.  The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 
2006 extended the deduction for qualified tuition and 
related expenses so that taxpayers may take advantage of 
it for 2006.  The previous deduction ended on December 31, 
2005.
This legislation passed in late December and retroactively 
made the deduction available for 2006.  This decision by 
Congress occurred long after the paper Form 1040 went to 
press, so the form does not includes directions as to how 
to take advantage of the deduction nor does the form 
contain a line item for the tuition deduction.
Detailed information about how to take advantage of this 
deduction is available at this IRS website: 
http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=165640,00.html A 
worksheet related to the tuition deduction can be 
downloaded at:
http://www.naicu.edu/2006TuitionDeduct.doc
Please review this information if you file your own tax 
return or forward it to parents or guardians who may be 
eligible for the tuition deduction.
[This information is not intended as legal or tax advice.  
Please consult with your personal tax advisor to determine 
your eligibility for any deduction or credit.]
Best wishes for a great winter term!
Terry Hogan
Dean of Students

Hey. Guys. Forgot to tell you something.
The Super Bowl is Sunday.  The party is at my house.  I'd love to have you 
guys come over and watch the big game here with us.  Show up around 6:00 on 
Sunday.  There'll be food and stuff here, so if you could spare a couple 
bucks to help me out, that'd be really cool.  Or if you can't, then come 
anyway!  It'll be a good time.
Just let me know if you're planning on coming so I can know how many to 
expect.  The girls have been invited too.  See you Sunday at 6.  Go Colts!

Prepare your space for sub-zero temperatures this weekend
jp354706@ohio.edu
Facilities Management
university.announcements@ohio.edu
Prepare your space for sub-zero temperatures this weekend
With the forecast of sub-zero temperatures this weekend, 
Facilities Management is asking for assistance from the 
university community. Please make sure all windows are 
closed tightly and remove any objects that might be pushed 
against heating units.
Keeping spaces warm helps prevent freezing and bursting of 
heating units and pipes, said Mick Harris, director of 
Maintenance and Operations. This winter is expected to be 
the coldest in the region for the previous three or four 
years.
Students living in the residence halls should make sure 
all personal effects are removed from the outside wall 
areas where the heating vents are located, Harris said. Do 
not hesitate to call Facilities Management at 593-2911 if 
a problem develops with heating units. Maintenance staff 
will be working each of the three dormitory areas (East, 
West and South greens) during the cold weather.
Facilities staff will be working through the early morning 
hours on Monday checking building equipment to avoid any 
freezing-related emergencies. Additionally, staff will be 
working similar schedules next week during the nights that 
have a forecast of sub-zero temperatures.

A Message from the Vice President for Student Affairs
jp354706@ohio.edu
Dr. Kent J. Smith Jr, Vice President for Student Affairs
university.announcements@ohio.edu
Dear Ohio University Students,
On Tuesday, I learned that the Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA) issued a report stating that 
it has notified Ohio University more than 1200 times this 
academic year about users of the campus network illegally 
downloading copyrighted music.
Because of the serious criminal and civil consequences 
associated with illegal file-sharing and because such 
activity limits network resources available for academic 
work, illegal downloading/file-sharing constitutes theft 
(just as if one took a music CD from a store without paying 
for it) as well as misuse or abuse of the computer network.  
Both are Code A offenses of the student code of conduct and 
offending students face disciplinary consequences, including 
suspension or expulsion from the university.
Up until now, we filed judicial charges only against 
students deemed to have engaged persistently in illegal 
file-sharing over the computer network.  However, in light 
of increased reports of the problem, all newly-reported, 
alleged first-time offenders will be referred to University 
Judiciaries in a manner consistent with our existing policy. 
For more information about the university's position on this 
matter, please visit 
http://www.ohiou.edu/notifications/on_copy.html
In moving forward, I will convene a task force of student 
leaders and staff to develop recommendations for additional 
ways we can educate students in order to prevent and address 
this illegal activity when it occurs.  Additionally, we will 
explore alternatives to CDigix for students to legally 
download music.  I will share more about this as more 
information becomes available.
Finally, for those students who are engaging in illegal 
download activity, I urge you to stop immediately and to 
delete all illegal files from your computers.  And, to the 
vast majority of you who are here working responsibly to 
pursue your educational goals, keep up the good work!   As 
always, I wish you well..  Please do not hesitate to call on 
me if I can assist you in making the most of your experience 
at Ohio University.
Cordially,
Dr. Kent J. Smith, Jr.
Vice President for Student Affairs

Summer research job
Me
Jonathan.plona@gmail.com
drabold@phy.ohiou.edu
Ken Hicks
hicks@ohio.edu
Jonathan,
I talked briefly with Dr. Drabold about the possibility of doing a summer
research project with an undergraduate with computer programming experience.
For background, Dr. Drabold is a Distinguished Professor, the highest rank
within the university, yet he is still rather young and, of course, very
active in research.  His area is theoretical condensed matter physics (i.e.,
the physics of solid material such as semiconductors and glass-like
amorphous materials).
Dr. Drabold would like to talk with you before he can decide whether to take
you on for a summer research project.  He is busy this week, but it would
not be a bad idea to contact him by email and set up a time next week when
you could stop by his office for a talk.  His email is
drabold@phy.ohiou.edu.
Please keep me informed about whether or not you come to an agreement with
Dr. Drabold.
Regards,
Dr. Hicks

110,
  At Saturday's basketball game, I put my band jacket in the storage room 
that we use.  After the game I grabbed my jacket and realized later that my 
ipod nano that was in my coat pocket was missing.  I know that jackets get 
moved around a lot after the game so I'm hoping that it just fell out the 
pocket and that someone picked it up.  It's black and has my name engraved 
on the back.  If anyone finds it, I'd really appreciate it being returned 
to me (as in there would be a reward)!  Thanks,

> Keep in mind that some of the people who are getting an average of

What is it you need to do on the computer?  Offhand I know of a way to get the admin password if you have physical access to the machine.  i'll send you instructions on how to do that later when I'm back at my dorm.  Hope that'll help.

Is the dread of exams getting to you? Wouldn't you love to just eat your 
sorrows away? YOU'RE IN LUCK!
Elissa Lawrence's team for Relay for Life, the Freaky Tikis, will be selling 
baked goods tomorrow (Friday) 11 a.m. - 2 p.m in front of the Track and Field 
Memorial Food Court (in Baker). We'll have several kinds of cookies, brownies, 
and cup cakes. The best part is, while you are fighting that looming

Dear Member of the Physics Community,
I am writing to ask you to consider a 2 page paper published yesterday in Progress in Physics.  The paper examines absorption and emission of microwave radiation in the Earth's atmosphere under steady state conditions.  It demonstrates that the CMB cannot have a cosmic origin.

I thought you'd get a kick out of this!
Regardless of where you stand on the issue of the U.S. involvement in Iraq, here's a sobering statistic. There has been a monthly average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq theatre of operations during the last 22 months, and a total of 2,867 deaths. That gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000 sol diers.
The firearm death rate in Washington D.C. is 80.6 per 100,000 persons for the same period. That means that you are about 25% more likely to be shot and killed in the U.S. Capital than you are in Iraq.
Conclusion: The U.S. should pull out of Washington, D.C.

Hey 110,
Ever wondered what the 110 Bible study actually does?
Ever wanted to go, but just can't find the time?
Ever wondered if the Bible is even relevant today?
Do you like free food?
If you said yes to any of those questions, then this is for you!
The 110 Bible study is going to be having an info-session on WEDNESDAY 
MARCH 28 at 6:00pm in BAKER 512.  Dinner will be provided, and you're 
invited!  This is a no-pressure, free time of hanging out and eating free 
food, and you can also find out a little about what the 110 Bible study 
does.
So if want a free meal, or if you've ever had questions about Bible study, 
I'd like to personally invite you to come, and bring a friend if you want. 
Contact me if you have any questions.  Wednesday night at 6pm in Baker 512.
See you then,
Josh Dufford

 To recap our discussion:
 1. You are retaking all 3 C- classes before the end of the summer.
 2. You are retaking the 2 D classes this quarter.
 3. You are dropping the other 2 classes this quarter and signing up for 2-3 C- classes.
 4. You are doing whatever costs the least amount of $ and takes the least amount of time - and allows you enough study time to get A's or B'+'s . You can figure this out and let us know what you decide to do after finding out about summer school. 
 5. You are paying for the retakes. Any future grade below a B- you will pay for the retake.

Hola Juan -
There are a couple of things to consider here, for both of us.
 Personally, I think it would be best for you to take a different section of 343, not because I would mind seeing you again, but rather so you could get a new experience from the course.
 However, I do know that all of the sections are overloaded and it will be impossible to get in another section.
 That said, I am teaching the same course that you attended in the fall, just in a 2-day-a-week schedule.
 I have already distributed the groups for mini-presentations and we met for the first week.
 I need to think about how you would participate in the mini-presentation exercise as the groups are equally distributed at this time.
Additionally, the activities in class are the same - the conversation will be somewhat different as this is a different group of students.
 The homework is a bit different - I added in reading assignments, but you needed to do them anyway.
The critical reviews would have to be different as well - you couldn't do the same ones you did for Fall quarter and you would have to do your presentation on a different film as well.
I need to think about this a bit more.
 Would you be able to stop by my office this afternoon around 3:45 so that we could discuss this?

Profesora Scott,
 You may or may not remember me, but this is Jonathan Plona.
 I was in your
Spanish 343 class fall quarter.
 I didn't do as well as I was hoping fall or
winter quarter, but didn't realize the trouble I was in until this week when I
sat down to do the math.
 After some time spent discussing my options with a
very informative lady, I've found out that I need to retake your class or I
will lose my scholarship.
 I know this is a bad time to discover something like
this, and that it might be too late, but I thought there might still be a
chance if I asked.
 I realize that the class is already full, and I understand
if you can't let me in.
 If you do, you need not expect the same type of
performance (or lack of it) that I displayed fall quarter.
 Thanks for you time.

Hola Juan -
I added you as an extra student to the Blackboard list this evening.
 You should be able to access SPAN 343 tomorrow.
 If not, let me know.
 Also - I am going to have to get back to you tomorrow morning regarding the mini-presentations.
If there is anything else, please let me know.

Profesora Scott,
 You may or may not remember me, but this is Jonathan Plona.
 I was in your
Spanish 343 class fall quarter.
 I didn't do as well as I was hoping fall or
winter quarter, but didn't realize the trouble I was in until this week when I
sat down to do the math.
 After some time spent discussing my options with a
very informative lady, I've found out that I need to retake your class or I
will lose my scholarship.
 I know this is a bad time to discover something like
this, and that it might be too late, but I thought there might still be a
chance if I asked.
 I realize that the class is already full, and I understand
if you can't let me in.
 If you do, you need not expect the same type of
performance (or lack of it) that I displayed fall quarter.
 Thanks for you time.

Please email her today and CC me and your Dad
 krivests@ohio.edu
 She is the ONLY one who will save your scholarship - do it now before she forgets or changes her mind. Tell her she talked with me last week and kindly agreed to manually refigure your scholarship eligibility at the end of the summer school course. Tell her you are retaking one of the courses in summer school. Thank her profusely!
 Call me with summer school details, dates, costs, etc. This is important because your Dad and I have to budget for summer in the dorm. Even if you lose the scholarship you will retake the last C- in summer school. "C"s are unacceptable from this point on.

Hey is anyone going to cincinnati over the weekend?  I tried the ride board 
and everyone else's cars are full.  If you could get back to me, that would be 
great.  I will pay all gas expenses.  Let me know if anyone can do this.

Hola Juan -
For the first mini-presentation to the class I would like for you to talk about immigration in the US, focusing on people who come from the Americas.
 Why to they come, how to they get here, who are they, problems that they face, etc.
 You can think about this in terms of the movie "Mar
a, llena eres de gracia," and think about what would be beneficial to know before watching the film.
 You have the advantage here of already having seen the film, so your perspective will be helpful to others.
Again it is a short 3-4 minute presentation that people will take notes on (and I need a copy too).
 You can refer to the homework section for Thursday to see more guidelines. And, of course, you will be giving this to the whole group.
I am still working on the other two topics, but wanted to get you started on this one.
Any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
Chau,

we're going to change the time to 8:00 for this week.  That's different 
from what we had decided before.  Also, if you've got a schedule, planner, 
or anything like that, bring it with you.  We'll try and nail down a date 
for us all to do some manly activity one weekend.  Bring any ideas you've 
got too.
Alright - see you at 8:00.

Hello Jonathan, 
We were sitting here and talking about you so we decided to send you a Email.
How are you? Are you coming home for Easter?
 Since you were just home for Spring Break it is not likely you will be home. But what do we know. 
What's going on at school?
 Anything new?
 Have you started band practice yet?
 How were the grades for the last quarter? 
A lot of questions for you to answer. 
Grampa is still getting radiation treatments. Today is his 25th with 12 more to go. He has good days and bad days.
 But he is taking everything in stride. 
Send us a Email when you have time.
We talk about you (all good things)
and think of you often. 
The weather here has been beautiful for the last week. However starting today and for the next ten days it is going to be in the thirties. What a bummer! 
WE LOVE YOU
 HAVE A HAPPY EASTER

Jonathan,
	I'm planning on leaving about two tomorrow, it is no big deal to drop you 
off in Montgomery that's not very far away when you figure you have to go 
through loveland and indianhill anyway.  I had another girl e-mail and said 
she needed a ride to so most likely it will be just you and her.  I'm 
assuming you need a ride back to ou on Sunday so just let me know on that. 
Just so you know my car is a little old it's a 1984 Mercury Grand Marquis, 
but it will make it there just fine.  I live in the university commons when 
I have done this in the past I have just picked people up at there dorms 
and left from there. What ever's easier I'm just trying to leave as close 
to 2 o'clock as possible.

Hey 110,
In case you haven't heard, there's a huge event coming to OU this week 
called The Veritas Forum.  It's a series of events that are an opportunity 
for the entire university community to explore some of life's hardest 
questions.  This is a BIG deal, as there will be several very intelligent, 
esteemed intellectuals coming to speak this Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
Thursday.
Check out any of these events that you can.  Actually, let's get a group of 
us 110ers together and meet up beforehand to go as a group.  Here's the 
run-down:
TUESDAY APRIL 10
"IS ANYONE OUT THERE?  IS THE MATERIAL WORLD ALL THERE IS?"
Dr. William Lane Craig - 8:00pm at the Convo
(110 - meet at 7:40pm on the first floor of Baker.)
WEDNESDAY APRIL 11
"WILL THE REAL JESUS PLEASE STAND UP?"
Dr. William Lane Craig - 8:00pm at the Convo
(110 - meet at 7:40pm on the first floor of Baker.)
THURSDAY APRIL 12
"FINDING GOD AT OHIO UNIVERSITY AND AT HARVARD"
Kelly Monroe Kullberg (OU '81) - 8:00pm at Old Nelson Commons
(110 - meet at 7:45pm in front of Old Nelson.)
If you'd rather go on your own, that's cool.  Just get there.  Also, 
there's a Wednesday afternoon panel discussion that'd I'd encourage you to 
check out.  For a complete schedule of events, or for more information 
about The Veritas Forum in general, go to http://www.veritas.org/OhioU/ .
That's all.  See you then.

Study abroad in Toledo, Spain
jp354706@ohio.edu
Arthur Hughes
hughesa@ohio.edu
hughesa@ohio.edu
There will be an information session held on Wednesday, 
April 11 at 3:00-4:00 pm in 113 Gordy Hall for students that 
are interested in studying abroad in Toledo, Spain.  
Highlights of the program are as follows.
The Toledo, Spain program provides the curriculum necessary 
for completing coursework (12-20 hrs/Quarter) for a Spanish 
major, minor, or specialization and for working towards 
obtaining a Certificate in European Studies. The principal 
objectives of this program are to increase participants_ 
overall proficiency in Spanish to an advanced level, to 
provide a curriculum that will develop the students_ 
abilities to read and appreciate literature and understand 
Spanish culture and history and to provide students with 
significant international experience. 
The program is designed for those students wishing to take 
300- and 400-level courses in Spanish language, literature 
and culture, and aims to advance students to a high level of 
language proficiency through total immersion in the language 
and active involvement in the community.  Classes are held 
at the Universidad Castilla-La Mancha Toledo campus and are 
taught both by OU and UCLM faculty.  
Students live with a Spanish family, which will provide them 
with a very significant part of their immersion.  Integral 
to the program is a series of excursions in and around this 
striking and historically rich region of central Spain. Some 
of the planned excursions include a guided tour of the Prado 
museum in Madrid, visits to the Cathedral and the Alc?r in 
Segovia, as well as exploration of Toledo and its 
surroundings.
Deadlines for Application.
Fall quarter 2007: April 6 - extended to April 13
Winter quarter 2008:  September 14
Spring quarter 2008:  January 11
Summer Session 2008:  April 11, 2008

Yo guys,
Just a reminder that we won't be meeting at my house for Bible study this 
week.  Wednesday night is the third of four events in the Veritas Forum, 
and we'll be going to that.  Dr. William Lane Craig will be speaking on 
Jesus' true identity.  I actually just got back from his talk tonight on 
the existence of God and it was intense!  My brain is still trying to 
absorb all the great arguments he explained.  This guy knows more than 
anyone I've ever met.  So expect tomorrow night to be amazing.
Meet at 7:40 on the first floor of Baker at the bottom of the escalators. 
I'll see you then.

Writing Assignment on Blackboard

jc267506@ohiou.edu
Hi All,
The next step in the process for writing your formal papers is posted on the Blackboard assignments page.  First drafts are due on the discussion board Friday evening, so I suggest you look at the assignment and start working on it soon.
Since the specifications are up on blackboard, I WILL NOT be printing them out for you and handing them out in class.  Also, we will not be going over the assignment in class, so make sure you read through the instructions.  Unless you email me or ask me questions in class, I am going to assume you understand the assignment.
Best,
Jen

I have a couple of questions: 
Do you have the Microsoft affice CDs?
 Here or there? 
Do you have any spare cables USB to standard printer - here - if so where can I find them?

Re: hey there how's it going????
It's going well, and it sounds like you're going to have an awesome weekend.  I tried to get out golfing today, but everyone else had the same idea it seems, so we couldn't get a tee time.  
I have all sorts of Office cd's. Office 2003 are the newest that I have, and you wouldn't like 2007 anyway.  
As far as the printer cable goes, it depends on what kind you're talking about.  If you're looking for a cable that goes from a USB to a parallel port (the big old school port) then i've never seen one of those.  If you're just looking for a USB cable that goes to the square printer-style USB port, then you have one of those in your desk drawer.  The bottom one on the left.
Hope that helped!

As you all know, we have been talking about doing something together one of

list of the weekends you guys would be available. Here are the potential 
weekends:
April 28th
May 5th
May 19th

If you guys could just respond to this email and let me know which dates 
you'd be available, that'd be great! Have a great week 4!

Hey Band,
	This Thursday evening Kappa Kappa Psi, the National Honorary Band 
Fraternity will be hosting its Formal Rush and First Degree Ritual in room 
101. We ask that if you are interested you arrive shortly before 9:45pm. 
Also, I ask that you please contact me before hand if you have not already 
attended a pre-rush event.
A little about Kappa Kappa Psi...
	Founded in 1919 in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Kappa Kappa Psi is the National 
Honorary Band Fraternity. We are a co-ed fraternity, so men and women are 
welcome! We exist based on the ideal that is in an honor to be selected to 
serve. Nationally there are over 160 chapters on College and University 
campuses. Notable alumni include John Phillip Sousa, William Revelli, Neil 
Armstrong, and Bill Clinton. At Ohio University Kappa Kappa Psi serves all 
of the university's bands. Our membership is comprised of a variety of 
majors and backgrounds making us a diverse group of students with whom any 
band member can relate. We look forward to greeting several new brothers 
this quarter, and hope to see a large turn out Thursday night! Thanks!
Robert Davis

Hello Jonathan, 
It was so nice hearing from you.
 It always is! 
Your life sounds more exciting than ours.
 The weather here is awful. Today it's in the forties and hopefully by Sunday they say it will be 70 degrees.
 I can't believe it. 
Grandpa has three more radiation treatments and he will be finished.
 It was a long 37 days! 
Cash your check whenever you can. I don't like to send cash because it might get lost or stolen. 
Take care of yourself and we hope to see you before too long. 
Love, 
Gram & Gramp

Hello Grandparents!
 I was thinking of you and thought I'd send you an email.
 I just got your easter card (I haven't been checking my mail regularly).
 Thanks a bunch for the card, and for the easter gift as well.
 It will be a little while before I can cash it, because my bank's at home.
 I hope everything's going well with you guys.
 It looks like the weather's going to improve this week, so hopefully we'll all be able to get outside more.
 There isn't much else to report, nothing exciting going on here in Athens.
 Email me back and let me know how you're doing! 
Love,
Jonathan

Jonathan,
As your advisor (and your teacher this quarter) I recommend that you drop
the class PHYS 453.  Since you have not handed in any of the homework
assignments, and homework is 50% of the grade for this class, it will be
difficult for you to catch up with the rest of the class.  In other words,
unless there is a dramatic turn-around in your homework grades, you are in
danger of failing PHYS 453.  If you drop before the 5th week of the quarter,
then this will not cause any problem for your GPA.  If you want to talk
about this situation, then stop by my office and we can discuss it.
Please reply so that I know that you received this email.
Regards,
Dr. Hicks

Hi Everyone,
Just a few reminders:
- Class is cancelled tomorrow, but you do need to post to the discussion board by 3 PM.  I put up a new forum (you're posting for me instead of your groups) with guidelines.
- We will be meeting in Ellis 18 - the computer lab - on Monday.  Make sure you either email yourself a copy of your paper or bring a disk or flashdrive with you so that you can work on your papers.
That's all.  Have a good weekend.

Generally when you cannot ping a computer on the network it means that they 
either have a firewall turned on, behind a router, or their computer does 
not have a proper IP address, in which case means that they cannot access 
the internet. If you have additional questions please feel free to call us 
directly at 593-1222.

Re: not Ping-able
Neither of the computers has a firewall turned on, and both are able to access the internet.  I tried to ping my friend accross campus, and that didn't work either.  I am able to ping external sites such as www.google.com.  It seems that the university is blocking pings.  If this is so, I would be curious to know what else they block.

Athens hotel closes doors

To:   All Athens campus students (grad and undergrad)
From: Dean of Students
Re:   Athens hotel closes doors
Dear student,
The Athens Lodge, formerly the Days Inn, has closed its 
doors without notifying future guests.  The Lodge was 
located at 330 Columbus Road in Athens.
As a result, the Athens County Convention and Visitors 
Bureau fears that many guests who have made reservations 
to stay at the Lodge will arrive in Athens only to find 
that it is closed and that they have no where to stay. 
The Athens Lodge was booked to capacity for the following 
weekends:
Mom's Weekend (May 4-6, 2007)
Commencement Weekend (June 8-10, 2007)
If your parents, relatives or friends are planning to 
visit the University on these or any other weekend, 
please alert them to this news.  They can check 
<http://www.athensohio.com> for Athens County lodging 
availabilities on upcoming OU event weekends.

Hey guys, what's up?  Hope y'all are having a good week.  In case you 
didn't notice, Wednesday is just about here, and in case you forgot, Bible 
study's goin' down at 7 at my place.  Again, please get here as close to 7 
as you can.  We're gonna hit some cool stuff this week, so I'd recommend 
reading the end of Mark 8 and some of Mark 9 beforehand, if you can.
Also, check your calendars for this Sunday.  I had the idea of going out to 
Strouds Run for lunch and to chill for a while on Sunday afternoon together 
with the girls' bible study.  1-3ish.  Think about it and let me know 
tomorrow.
That's all for now.  See you Wednesday evening.

Hey Dad.
If you're looking to stay for a night, you could come on Tuesday afternoon (i'm done with class at 4) and on Wednesday I'm done with class at 11, which leaves the day open for golf.  Next weekend i'm going camping with some friends from church, and I'm pretty busy with class the rest of the week.

 						Hi, Tim again, 						
 						
 						First, I wanted to thank you again for the support last week.
 It was absolutely overwhelming.
 More than 200,000 Pandora listeners contacted their congressional representatives!
 The entire fax infrastructure on Capitol Hill ground to a halt.
 We had to deliver faxes manually - literally boxes full of them were delivered to every office in the Capitol building. 
 						
 						
 						The result has been swift and dramatic: more than a million people have already joined the cause!
 There is now a bill just being introduced called the "Internet Radio Equality Act, H.R. 2060" to fix the problem and save Internet radio -and Pandora- from obliteration.
 						
 						
 						I'd like to ask you to do one more thing which is to call and ask your Congressperson, Jean Schmidt, to co-sponsor the Internet Radio Equality Act, H.R. 2060:
 						
 						
 						Jean Schmidt's phone number: (202)225-3164
 						
 						
 						This fight for our life is not over, but there has been a marked shift in momentum.
 Thanks to your efforts, this vital channel for musical diversity has a hope of finally being treated fairly and being allowed to grow and nurture a newly empowered class of independent musicians.
 						
 						
 						Your opinion matters to your representatives - so please take just a minute to call. 						
 						
 						Visit www.savenetradio.org: <http://www.savenetradio.org/>  to continue following the fight to Save Internet Radio. 						
 						
 						Thanks again for being such a wonderful supporter.

smitha2@ohio.edu
								
				Course:  PHYS 273
				Title:   ELECTRONICS LAB
				Instructor:  SMITH, ARTHUR
				Term:  2006 - 2007 Spring
				
				Dear 273 Student:
According to the original syllabus, the midterm was to be handed out on Wednesday next week and returned to me at 4pm on Thursday. However, since I would like you to turn in the next lab report on Thursday and since we don't meet on Wednesday, this would be difficult. Therefore I will hand out the midterm to you on Thursday in class and ask that you turn it in to me by 5pm Friday. 
Your 5th lab report, due next Thursday, will cover just those two experiments that we did this week, as usual. 
As far as the lab time for next week, I will give you two options: a) use the time for catch-up for any labs you have already started and not finished; b) perform 1 or 2 additional op-amp experiments for additional (extra) credit. I will explain how I will credit it to you next week.
See you,
A. Smith

poetry paper
Me
Jonathan.plona@gmail.com
Lehla Kisor
lehlak@gmail.com
Anna Kwa and Lehla Kisor
"Nothing can ever happen twice." That is as absolute a statement as has ever
been made, and so it leaves nothing up to interpretation.  However, Wislawa
Syzmborska's poem "Nothing Twice" is almost hypocritical in nature. While
some ideas in the poem are obviously expressed, others are left cryptic to
the reader, only to be understood through careful attention and study. Even
then, the meaning can either be interpreted differently or continue to
escape the analyst.
The meaning of the first three stanzas of the poem is obvious. Nothing can
ever happen exactly the same way. You can eat breakfast every day but you
won't be doing it at exactly the same time or in the same way, because time
will always have passed and you will always be a day older.  Also, the
emotions that you experience even when doing repetitive activities are
constantly fluctuating. In her Nobel Lecture Syzmborska imagines a
conversation with the Biblical writer Ecclesiastes, who wrote "there's
nothing new under the sun." She rebukes him by saying that *he* was new
under the sun, and so were his ideas and all of the people reading them. And
although joy may be fleeting, even that doesn't matter because there will be
new poems and drafts and notes written about it, maybe even by Ecclesiastes
himself.  Her assertion that all creations are new and different supports
the theme of "Nothing Twice." Just as no creations are the same, no
experiences are the same
they're all new under the sun as well. "No day
copies yesterday, /no two nights will teach what bliss is /in precisely the
same way, /with exactly the same kisses."
In the fourth stanza of the poem, there is a definite shift. The author
stops talking to and about "you" as a nonspecific reader, but instead the
"you" she uses in reference to a certain person. For the first time in the
poem, she also uses "I." These pronouns continue to appear and have specific
meaning throughout the rest of the poem. From here on, the poem is much
harder to understand and is open for greater interpretation. There are two
different interpretations that we have been able to come up with regarding
the stanza with the rose and the clock. The placement of the comma is very
important in the line "The next day, though you're here with me," because
the placement implies 'even though' instead of 'while.' Both of us misread
it the first time; it seems that a poem with romantic implications would
stress time spent together, not offer it as a side note. The person who is
mentioned in the fourth stanza is actually with the speaker in the fifth,
and she can't help looking at the clock.
One interpretation is that she was enthralled with the person the day
before, but changed her mind the next and can't wait for their time together
to end. This is supported by the lines "A rose? A rose? What could that be?
Is it a flower or a rock?" if they're interpreted to mean that she cannot
see why she thought him as interesting as a rose when now she sees him no
more interesting than a rock. In this case, the rose symbolizes life's
unpredictability and constant change, and that eternal love is not a
guarantee. The mention of her loved one's name evokes the imagery of a rose
"all hue and scent"- a pleasant thought but color and smell are abstract
qualities that both can fade.  Like a dying rose, the color and fragrance
fades away when the speaker realizes she is no longer infatuated with the
person in stanza four. With this interpretation, the ending is a bit more
difficult to understand. If she is bored with him, why would she seek accord
with him? Did she just change her mind again, or is she realizing that at
the basic level people are the same but their interests are not compatible
enough for a relationship, and wants him to agree?
A second interpretation suggests that the speaker would be enjoying the time
she is spending with her loved one, but she is too busy worrying that the
time will come to an end too quickly. As a result, her love is not worth as
much as a beautiful rose; instead, it's only as pleasant as a rock. In the
end, even though these two people are different from one another just as all
events are different, they realize that if they live in the moment instead
of worrying about all the superfluous details they can live in harmony. Two
drops of water, while two separate entities, can easily become one.
Like all poetry, Szymborska's "Nothing Twice" can be interpreted differently
by different people and in all cases can still leave the reader wanting to
comprehend the little questions that still escape their understanding.
Nevertheless, the poem clearly asserts the theme that you can only live each
moment once, so don't worry bout the things you cannot change. This gives
the poem a laid-back, optimistic tone that allows the reader to look forward
rather than into the past at their mistakes.
Other questions for class discussion:
Do you agree with the poem that you only get one chance? Why practice for
things? Is all practice in vain?  (In music- improve versus a memorized
piece of music?)
Why is it a "sorry fact" that "we arrive here improvised and leave without
the chance to practice?"
What effect does translating the poem have on its meaning? How much power
does the translator have in expressing his interpretation of the poem?
Because all poems can be interpreted differently, right? (Especially when
trying to make it rhyme)
Does the fact the she grew up in Soviet Russia influence her ideas that all
things were different, perhaps as a reaction to the forced uniformity?

Re: poetry paper
That is as absolute a statement as has ever
been made,
That's sort of an absolute, I don't like it.  How about "such a strong statement leaves little to interpretation"
Interpreted differently by whom, or compared to what.
Hypocritical doesn't make sense.  You don't support this in your paper.
I'm about to fall asleep, so I can't really concontrate more.  Don't forget to call me please.

Dear John, 
Thank you for your interest in Kingston Technology. 
The Kingston part that you referenced KVR533D2/1GR is for generic white box systems and is not recommended for banded system such as HP/Compaq. 
The KTH-XW4300/512 is the recommended part number for your system. 
 When Kingston offers memory for an OEM system like Hp/Compaq , 
(396520-001) this means it is designed to be physically and functionally equivalent to the original manufacturer memory. 
Kingston Technology offers two memory product lines: Kingston Branded and ValueRAM. While both product lines are made with premium components and are carefully designed and manufactured, they differ in support and testing services. The information below clarifies these differences and will assist you in selecting the correct product. 
Kingston Branded Memory 
Kingston's branded memory line has been designed, manufactured and tested to the specifications of each particular brand name computer system. Kingston's branded memory is tested more extensively, being subjected to system-specific tests, system/chip compatibility tests, system/chip performance tests, as well as having a controlled build of materials and adherence to system-specific constraints and production requirements. 
Use our Memory Configurator to determine the right memory for you. 
ValueRAM Memory 
ValueRAM memory by Kingston is our value-priced line of industry-standard, generic memory. ValueRAM is available for those customers who have a white box or generic computer system, or who plan to purchase memory by specification. Our ValueRAM line is: 
* Designed to industry specifications 
* Available at competitively low prices 
* 100% tested 
Lastly, ValueRAM memory carries a lifetime warranty, however, returns are for defective product only 
For more information visit http://www.valueram.com/ 
However, if you are purchasing memory for a name brand computer system and want to be sure that the memory you purchase has been designed and tested for your particular system, use our Memory Configurator, 
If you should ever encounter problems with our memory, we offer toll-free tech support and a free replacement policy should the product be defective. 
You may purchase from our online store directly or through our extensive network of more than 3,000 distributors and resellers worldwide. 
If you would like to purchase directly from our manufacturer direct online store, save time, and receive FREE shipping, with a minimum purchase*, on any order in the continental US, please click on the above link and follow the prompts.

Hey,
So it has finally arrived. The weekend in which us 110 bible study men are 
going to rough it out in the thick of the woods. I was thinking Old Man's 
Cave would be a good place. My roommate went there and showed me some 
pictures of it, and it was quite scenic. I've been camping before at a site 
like this, and it's most likely only going to be $14 all together.
I know Darryl mentioned Sunday night some of the south green bible study 
men were going to go camping. I don't know how you guys felt about joining 
up with them, but we can talk about it Wednesday. If you aren't going to be

Rick Seiter and Vickie Ball-Seiter needs some help moving a 600 pound lathe.
 Currently, the lathe is in their basement (22 Hooper St., Athens) and needs to be moved
up the steps and out into their garage.
 This will take 5-6 very strong backs (seriously) to carry.
 It's
awkward and greasy.
Eventually it will be
moved to their Farm in Millfield that they just purchased.
 If possible we would like to do this on Thursday (24th) or Friday, May 25th at 5:30 p.m.
Please contact Rick ASAP and let him know if you can help.
 Email:  <mailto:seiter@ohio.edu> seiter@ohio.edu.
 Thanks in advance for considering this.

Yo guys,
I called North Bend State Park in WV today and asked about camping there 
this weekend.  They said the only place we could use this weekend without a 
reservation was - and I quote - "primitive."  (Later, I found out that this 
meant probably only a port-a-john for a bathroom, some kind of water pump, 
no electric, and not much shade.)  I'm fine with this, but if anyone has a 
problem with it, let me know ASAP or forever hold your peace.  Or your pee. 
Haha.
Let's meet at the food court in Baker at 5:30 Friday.  We can grab some 
food, talk about what we need, and afterward see if it'll all fit in the 
car.  Hope you guys are as excited as I am.  Get jacked!  See you tomorrow.

Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
This is really an awesome sight to watch. Very fascinating. 
 82da68d5.jpg  <cid:000401c696e7$09687410$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
1. How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the 
tomb of the Unknowns and why? 
21 steps. It alludes to the twenty-one gun salute, which is the 
highest honor given any military or foreign dignitary. 
 82da68e5.jpg  <cid:000501c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
2. How long does he hesitate after his about face to begin his 
return walk and why? 
21 seconds for the same reason as answer number 1
 82da68f4.jpg  <cid:000601c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
3. Why are his gloves wet? 
His gloves are moistened to prevent his losing his grip on the 
rifle.
 82da6904.jpg  <cid:000701c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
4. Does he carry his rifle on the same shoulder all the time 
and if not, why not? 
He carries the rifle on the shoulder away from the tomb. 
After his march across the path, he executes an about face 
and moves the rifle to the outside shoulder. 
 82da6914.jpg  <cid:000801c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
5. How often are the guards changed? 
Guards are changed every thirty minutes, 
twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year.
 82da6923.jpg  <cid:000901c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
6. What are the physical traits of the guard limited to? 
For a person to apply for guard duty at the tomb, he must be 
between 5' 10" and 6' 2" tall and his waist size cannot exceed 30." Other 
requirements of the Guard: They must commit 2 years of life to guard the 
tomb, live in a barracks under the tomb, and cannot drink any alcohol on 
or off duty for the rest of their lives. They cannot swear in public for the 
rest of their lives and cannot disgrace the uniform {fighting} or the tomb in 
any way. After two years, the guard is given a wreath pin that is worn on 
their lapel signifying they served as guard of the tomb. There are only 
400 presently worn. The guard must obey these rules for the rest of their 
lives or give up the wreath pin. 
The shoes are specially made with very thick soles to keep the heat 
and cold from their feet. There are metal heel plates that extend to the 
top of the shoe in order to make the loud click as they come to a halt. 
There are no wrinkles, folds or lint on the uniform. Guards dress for duty 
in front of a full-length mirror. 
The first six months of duty a guard cannot talk to anyone, nor 
watch TV. All off duty time is spent studying the 175 notable people laid 
to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. A guard must memorize who they are 
and where they are interred. Among the notables are: President Taft, Joe 
E. Lewis {the boxer} and Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy, {the most 
decorated soldier of WWII} of Hollywood fame. 
Every guard spends five hours a day getting his uniforms ready for 
guard duty. 
 82da6933.jpg  <cid:000a01c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
ETERNAL REST GRANT THEM O LORD, AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON THEM. 
In 2003 as Hurricane Isabelle was approaching Washington, DC, our 
US Senate/House took 2 days off with anticipation of the storm. On the ABC 
evening news, it was reported that because of the dangers from the 
hurricane, the military members assigned the duty of guarding the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier were given permission to suspend the assignment. They 
respectfully declined the offer, "No way, Sir!" Soaked to the skin, 
marching in the pelting rain of a tropical storm, they said that guarding 
the Tomb was not just an assignment, it was the highest honor that can be 
afforded to a serviceperson. The tomb has been patrolled continuously, 
24/7, since 1930. 
 82da6943.jpg  <cid:000b01c696e7$096ae510$c4798318@ediar60g6h9v5c> 
God Bless and keep them.

Well, it appears African-Americans have found yet something else to be pissed about. 
A black congresswoman reportedly complained that the names of hurricanes are all Caucasian sounding names. 
She would prefer some names that reflect African-American culture, such as Chamiqua, Tanisha, Woeisha, Shaqueal, and Jamal. 
She would also like the weather reports to be broadcast in language that street people can understand because one of the problems in New Orleans is that regular folks couldn't understand the seriousness of the situation due to the racially biased language of the weather report. 
I can hear it now: A Houston weatherman says: 
"Wazzup, mutha-fukkas! Hehr-i-cane

A Message From Arthur Smith, PHYS 273  Instructor
JP354706@ohio.edu
smitha2@ohio.edu
								
				Course:  PHYS 273
				Title:   ELECTRONICS LAB
				Instructor:  SMITH, ARTHUR
				Term:  2006 - 2007 Spring
				
				Dear 273 student:
This note is to remind you to turn in all of your not-yet-turned-in lab reports, if you have not yet done so. Any labs you performed prior to last week (up to, and including, "Intro to Programmable Microcontroller" performed on May 17th) were already due before now and will only be accepted up to this coming Thursday (May 31). Also on that day, your lab report covering what you did last week [PMC (B) and (C)] will be due. It can be turned in late only up until Thursday June 7. After June 7, no lab reports of any kind will be accepted.
Your final exam, to be handed out as take-home on that Thursday, will be due the following day June 8 at 5pm.
This week (May 29th and 31st), we will be doing some really important and nice things with the PMC, including learning pulse-width modulation, an excellent concept. While you will not have any lab report over this last week's material, I fully expect you to be present. You could even see some question(s)/problem(s) on the final exam related to this material.
So see you Tuesday!
A. Smith

Dear OU Musician:
The 2007 Concert Under the Elms Series will begin on June 18-19 with  
guest soloists John Jones, tuba and Brett Shuster, brass faculty from  
the University of Louisville.
You are invited to participate in any or all of the concerts as your  
schedule permits.  The summer band consists of approximately 90  
musicians and is comprised of music teachers, community musicians,  
students and faculty from a variety of academic disciplines.   
Rehearsals are held on Tuesday nights and concerts are Wednesday  
evening at 7pm on the main college green.  We perform music in a  
variety of styles and this is a great opportunity to improve your  
reading skills.
I am excited about this season's guest soloists and conductors and  
hope you can join us for many of the performances.
Attached is the schedule.  Please contact me if you  have any questions.

Dear all,
Hope
you're having a great summer.
 If you are one of the ones that signed "Maybe" on your intent form for the North Carolina trip in August, as soon as you know, please let me know if you can go or not.
 I need many of you that replied "Maybe" to say yes, so if you can possibly go, please do.
 the second thing is that we couldn't secure the dates we wanted at the Ohio Theatre, so we'll be at the Palace Theatre (as we were in 2004) on Tuesday, Nov. 13.
Thanks and I'll keep you updated on other things,

Made in America at ArkivMusic

Jonathan.plona@gmail.com
President@ArkivMusic.com
Dear Mr. Plona, 
It's the season for American music at ArkivMusic and we have some 
blockbuster new releases that celebrate American ensembles as well, 
including a notable premier in Nashville, an irresistible Gottschalk 
extravaganza from the Hot Springs Festival, and a simply beautiful 
recording from Indianapolis.  With the quintessential music of Aaron 
Copland and John Philip Sousa we have, in all, a balanced selection 
highlighting America's great achievements in the concert hall with 
some superb soundtracks for sipping lemonade on the porch.
Notable premier in Nashville:

Simply beautiful recording:

John Philip Sousa:
http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Sousa
  *  Made in America is the world premiere recording of a work 
     commissioned by 65 American orchestras. The music is by Joan 
     Tower, one of America's foremost composers, and the recording 
     by Leonard Slatkin and the Nashville Symphony is the first from 
     Nashville's brand new concert hall at the Schermerhorn Symphony 
     Center. 6.99
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607MadeIn 
  *  American Dreams - An ArkivMusic favorite, this ideal collection 
     includes Barber's Adagio and Gershwin's Lullaby along with 
     Carpenter's Sea Drift, Canning's Justin Morgan Fantasy and Hoagy 
     Carmichael's Johnny Appleseed Suite. 13.99
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Dreams
  *  Louis Moreau Gottschalk's Orchestral works - Recorded at the Hot 
     Springs Music Festival, this new disc includes the complete 
     orchestral works of "The Chopin of the Creoles". 6.99
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Gottschalk
  *  Don Ray: Homestead Dances, Family Portrait - Don Ray wrote lots 
     of music for television, including Gunsmoke and Hawaii Five-O. 
     He also wrote these delightful works that revel in the sort of 
     rural Americana popularized by Copland and Virgil Thomson.  13.99
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Ray
  *  John Philip Sousa: Music for Wind Band - Look no further for a 
     patriotic feast. The parade can last all day with these five volumes 
     by "The March King" - 6.99 each.
     John Philip Sousa:
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Sousa2
     Five volumns:
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Sousa
  *  Aaron Copland: Appalachian Spring, Quiet City - A Copland disc 
     that's practically perfect from just about any perspective - 
     Gambill conducts this piece as well as anyone ever has. 6.99
     http://www.arkivmusic.com/America0607Copland
  *  The American Symphonies Collection - 25 CDs - Arkiv Music offers 
     an exclusive survey of the symphony in America. Containing 
     complete representative works from Ives, Copland, Barber,

Buddy - just a quick note on some thoughts - first - keep youe cell near you tonight we need to talk agaIN.
 Second - if you are going to stay in college you neeed to retake the 5 spring courses. You have to replace those F's - it will take too long to bring up a 1.4 whatever gradepoint. You also need to do it to get off suspension.
 Go to your summer school class - pay for it with your Dad's money and we will loan you the rest. Do it today. 
 Work hard at your summer class.
 Sign up for another if it's not too late.
 We will figure this out Buddy - we all know you can do it. You know it too. You deserve the best your god given talents can provide for you - they can take you so far but you have to be patient and work hard. Be grateful for your intelligence, and the fact that we can afford to send you to college - there is no reason to feel undeserving - be thankful. 
 We all have our albatross in life - your smarts may be a double edged sword. Your intelligence is a gift - but also hampers your motivation because you are bored. BUT - you still need to get done what needs to get done Buddy. That is your hardship and your challenge and your job. Being smart isn't easy at all - and you thought life was too easy for you! You can overcome.
 I have to go to work now but wanted to share some of my thoughts.
 Love you. Mom

Hello!
Good morning Heather!  
It's been a few days since we've talked, so I thought I'd send you an email before I went to bed.  How was your weekend? Hopefully the weather will stay nice for you today.  If you get bored, text me.  Here's a joke for you:  what has two knees and swims in the ocean?  Let me know when you figure it out or give up.

Call me today about the ebill - go online - how much was your Dads check for? Where is the dorm fee? The $701 I gave you was for the dorm. Where is the 2nd class? Check your schedule - it does not reflect this class. How did you pay for it?
 Let me know what your advisor says. and band - I still have suks email if noone is in the band office - suk@ohio.edu. Admissions would know also. Band is not critical to do though but if you need to stay up another summer term I have to budget for it ahead of time.
 I tlaked to your Dad and you must see your advisor now Bud if we are going to keep to you in school. Also Counseling Services - they deal with this all the time.

 If you dont like the counselor we'll get you another but its important to figure this out before its too late.
 You must also do OK on grades summer and fall - after that you come home and work fulltime, go to UC if you want. There is nothing more we can do - God helps those that help themselves. It's your turn now. 
 Love you. Call me today. Mom

Kelli
I'm having trouble sleeping again, so I thought I'd email you with a little more detail about Kelli and the situation.  Part of why i'm worried about it is because she's never dated anyone before.  You may have never thought about it, but it's a lot of responsibility being someone's first boyfriend, or at least it feels that way.  There's a lot of pressure to do things right, because the first one is special.  Or it should be.  I still regret not making my first relationship mean more, and I wouldn't want to bring that on someone else.  On the other hand, I do enjoy being around her, and i'm nev bored when we hang out, but she gets kind of awkward when she's excited.  I hang out with her and her roommate pretty much all the time.  We usually sit close to each other, and I'll put my arm around her, or heads will be on shoulders, or hands will be on arms, or we'll be tickling each other, or having sex or sort of holding hands or something like that.  I can tell she's never done that before because it's almost like she doesn't know how.  Maybe i'm just used to being with you where we both know what the other wants without having to say anything.  Oh well.  You'll probably see what I mean when you come up.  Thanks for your help!

Hi Grandson, 
What's new with you?
 Spoke to your Dad yesterday and he said he has not heard from you either.
 I guess you are buried in your books. Hope all is going well with you and your studies.
 You must be half way through this course.
Did you do anything exciting on the fourth of July?
 Dad said it rained so hard in Cincinnati that the fire works were postponed. 
We had a cookout here with Aunt Lilly and her family.
 It was a nice day. 
Grandpa is coming along nicely.
 Feeling better every day. He goes to the doctor this coming Tuesday. Will let you know what he has to say. 
Send us a Email whenever you have time.
 We think of you often and hope all is going well for you. 
We love you, 
Grandpa & Grandma

Re: Hey there!
Hi!
I was just thinking of sending you guys an email, but it looks like you best me to it.  Not much is new with me, same as usual. My summer is going well, it's very relaxing so far.  Some of my friends and I grilled out on the fourth, and then went to see the Athens fireworks.  Luckily we only caught a part of the rain.  I'm glad to hear that Grandpa is doing well, and I hope the doctor's visit goes smoothly.  How are things going otherwise?  Hopefully you have the same sort of weather we have down here, it's been really beautiful lately.  I hope everything else is splendid, and I can't wait to hear from you again!
Love,
Jonathan

Last Chance for Na

Jonathan.plona@gmail.com
President@ArkivMusic.com
Dear Mr. Plona, 
I have two quick mentions in the heat of the summer here at ArkivMusic <http://www.arkivmusic.com/home> :
First, we just received one of the most extraordinary budget CD sets I 
have ever seen, an import from Germany of the  <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707Beethoven> Beethoven Complete 
Masterworks. On 60 CDs, it is extraordinary not only for the price 
(59.98 - one dollar per disc!) but also for containing so many 
critically-acclaimed performances. As with all imports, quantities 
are limited.
Second, we are in the last days of our sale on the Na
ve label <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707Naive>  from 
France, which ends this Friday, July 13th at midnight.
There is so much captivating music to discover, from the landmark
 Vivaldi Edition <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707Vivaldi>  to the transporting choral transcriptions of Accentus <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707Accentus> .
Here are just a few stellar picks from the catalog:
* Vivaldi's  <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707VivaldiGriselda> Griselda -- The best-selling opera is back in stock.
 This performance is sublime. Don't miss the chance for this 
 spectacular recording at this price - 3 CDs for 21.98!
* Mozart: Piano Concertos No 12,  21 & 23 / Fazil Say <http://www.arkivmusic.com/LastChance0707Mozart>  -- First-rate 
 performances that are consistently joyful and consistently 
 winning. 12.99

The camp lay about a league farther on, well back from the road among low, wooded hills, just beyond a stream that was ten paces' width of stones and only five of water never deeper than a man's knees. Tiny green and silver fish darted away from the horses' hooves. Casual passersby were unlikely to come on them here. The nearest inhabited farm was over a mile away, and Perrin had checked personally to make sure those folk took their animals to water elsewhere. 
He truly had been trying to avoid notice as much as possible, traveling by back roads and the smallest country paths when they could not keep to the forests. A futile effort, really. The horses could be pastured wherever there was grass, but they required at least some grain, and even a small army had to buy food, and a lot of it. Every man needed four pounds a day, in flour and beans and meat. Rumors must have been floating all over Ghealdan, though with luck, no one suspected who they were. Perrin grimaced. Perhaps they had not, until he went and opened his mouth. Still, he would have done nothing differently. 
It was three camps really, close to one another and none far from the stream. They traveled together, all following him, obeying him supposedly, but there were too many personalities involved, and no one was entirely sure the others aimed at the same goal. Some nine hundred or so Winged Guards had their cook fires crowded between rows of picketed horses in a broad meadow of trampled brown grass. He tried to close his nose to the mingled smells of horses, sweat, dung and boiling goat meat, an unpleasant combination on a hot day. A dozen mounted sentries rode a slow circuit in pairs, their long, red-streamered lances all at precisely the same angle, but the rest of the Mayeners had shed breastplates and helmets. Coatless and often shirtless in the sun, they lay sprawled on their blankets or diced as they waited on the food. Some looked up as Perrin passed, a number straightened from what they were doing to study the additions to his party, but none came running, so the patrols were still out. Small patrols, without lances, who could see without being seen. Well, that was the hope. It had been. 
A handful of gai'shain moved at various chores among the Wise Ones' low gray-brown tents on the sparsely wooded crest of the hill above the Mayeners. At this distance, the white-robed figures appeared harmless, eyes downcast and meek. Up close, they would look the same, but most were Shaido. The Wise Ones claimed gai'shain were gai'shain; Perrin did not trust any Shaido out of his sight. Off to one side on the slope, beneath a bedraggled sourgum, perhaps a dozen Maidens in cadin'sor knelt in a circle around Sulin, the toughest of them despite her white hair. She had sent out scouts, too, women who could move as fast afoot as the Mayeners on their horses and were much more likely to escape unwanted attention. None of the Wise Ones up there were in the open, but a slender woman stirring a large stew kettle straightened, knuckling her back as she watched Perrin and the others pass. A woman in a green silk riding dress. 
He could see the glare on Masuri's face. Aes Sedai did not stir kettles, nor perform twenty other tasks the Wise Ones had her and Seonid doing. Masuri laid it at Rand's feet, but he was not here, and Perrin was. Given half a chance, she would peel his hide for him. 
Edarra and Nevarin turned up that way, even in those bulky skirts barely disturbing the layers of dead leaves that carpeted the ground. Seonid followed, her cheeks still bulging around that scarf. She twisted in her saddle, peering back at Perrin. If he could have believed an Aes Sedai looking anxious, that was what he would have called her. Riding behind her, Furen and Teryl wore scowls. 
Masuri saw them coming and hastily bent back to the black kettle, stirring with renewed vigor, trying to make out that she had never stopped. So long as Masuri stayed in the Wise Ones' charge, Perrin thought he did not have to worry about his hide. The Wise Ones seemed to keep a very short leash. 
Nevarin looked back over her shoulder at him, another of those dark stares he had been getting from her and Edarra since sending his warning, his threat, by the stubble-cheeked fellow. Perrin exhaled in exasperation. He did not have to worry about his pelt unless the Wise Ones decided they wanted it. Too many personalities. Too many goals. 
Maighdin rode at Faile's side, seemingly paying no attention to what they passed, but he would not have wagered a split copper on it. Her eyes had widened a hair at sight of the Mayener sentries. She knew what red breastplates and helmets like rimmed pots meant, as surely as she had recognized an Aes Sedai face. Most people would not have known either, especially not folk dressed as she was. She was a mystery, this Maighdin. For some reason, she seemed vaguely familiar. 
Lini and Tallanvor 
 that was what he had heard Maighdin call the fellow who had ridden after her; "young" Tallanvor, though there could not have been more than four or five years between them if that 
 stayed as close behind Maighdin as possible, with Aram in the way trying to heel Perrin. So did a little stick of a fellow with a pursed mouth, called Balwer, who seemed to pay less heed to their surroundings than Maighdin pretended. Even so, Perrin thought Balwer saw more than she did. He could not say why, precisely, but the few times he had caught the bony little man's scent, he had been minded of a wolf testing the air. Strangely, there was no fear in Balwer, only quickly suppressed ridges of irritation shot through with the quivery smell of impatience. The remainder of Maighdin's companions trailed along well back. The third woman, Breane, was whispering fiercely to a hulking fellow who kept his eyes down and sometimes nodded silently, sometimes shook his head. A shoulder-striker and street tough if ever there was one, but the short woman had an edge of toughness about her, too. The last man sheltered behind those two, a stout man with a battered straw hat pulled low to hide his face. On him, the sword the men all wore looked as strange as it did on Balwer. 
The third part of the camp, spread out among the trees just around the curve of the hill from the Mayeners, covered as much ground as the Winged Guards' though it held far fewer people. Here, the horses were picketed well away from the cook fires, so the unblemished smell of dinner filled the air. Roasting goat, this time, and hard turnips the farmers probably had intended to feed to their pigs even with times as hard as they were. Close on to three hundred Two Rivers men who had followed Perrin away from home were tending meat on spits, mending clothes, checking over arrows and bows, all scattered in haphazard clumps of five or six friends around a fire. Nearly every one of them waved and shouted greetings, though there was too much of "Lord Perrin" and "Perrin Goldeneyes" to suit him. Faile had a right to the titles they gave her. 
Grady and Neald, unsweating in their night-black coats, did not cheer; standing beside the cook fire they had built a little away from everyone else, they merely looked at him. Expectant looks, he thought. Expecting what? That was the question he always asked himself about them. The Asha'man made him uneasy, more than Aes Sedai or Wise Ones. Women channeling the Power was natural, if not exactly anything a man could be comfortable around. Plain-faced Grady appeared a farmer despite his coat and sword, and Neald a popinjay with his curled mustaches, yet Perrin could not forget what they were, what they had done at Dumai's Wells. But then, he had been there, too. The Light help him, he had. Pulling his hand from the axe at his belt, he dismounted. 
Servants, men and women from Lord Dobraine's estates in Cairhien, came running from the lines where the horses were picketed, to take their mounts. None stood taller than Perrin's shoulder, country-clad folk, forever bowing and curtsying obsequiously. Faile said he just upset them when he tried to make them stop, or at least not to bob around him so often; in truth, that was how they smelled when he did, and they always went back to bobbing in an hour or two. Others, nearly as many as the Two Rivers men, were working with the horses or around the long rows of high-wheeled carts that hauled all their supplies. A few were darting in and out of a large red-and-white tent. 
As usual, that tent made Perrin grunt gloomily. Berelain had a larger one back in the Mayener part of the camp, plus one for her two maids and another for the pair of thief-catchers she had insisted on bringing. Annoura had a tent of her own, and Gallenne as well, but only he and Faile possessed one here. For himself, he would have slept under the sky like the other men from home. They had nothing over them at night but a blanket. There was certainly no fear of rain. The Cairhienin servants bedded down beneath the carts. He could not ask Faile to do that, though, not when Berelain had a tent. If only he could have left Berelain in Cairhien. But then he would have had to send Faile into Bethal. 
A pair of banners on tall, fresh-cut poles in the middle of a clear space near the tent soured his mood further. The breeze had picked up a trifle, though it was still too warm; he thought he heard that thunder again, faint in the west. The flags unfolded in slow waves, collapsed of their own weight, rippled open again. His crimson-bordered Red Wolfhead and the Red Eagle of long-dead Manetheren, out in the open again despite his orders. Perhaps he had stopped trying to hide, after a fashion, but what was now Ghealdan had been part of Manetheren; Alliandre would not be soothed by hearing of that banner! He managed a pleasant face and a smile for the stocky little woman who curtsied deeply and took Stepper away, but it was a near thing. Lords were supposed to be obeyed, and if he was supposed to be a lord, well, he seemed to be making a poor job of it. 
Fists on her hips, Maighdin stood studying those rippling flags as her horse was taken off with the rest. Surprisingly, Breane had both their bundles, held awkwardly; she wore a petulant scowl, directed at the other woman. "I have heard about banners like those," Maighdin said suddenly. And angrily; there was no anger in her voice, and her face was smooth as ice, but her fury filled Perrin's nose. "They were raised by men in Andor, in the Two Rivers, who rebelled against their lawful ruler. Aybara is a Two Rivers name, I think." 
"We don't know much about lawful rulers in the Two Rivers, Mistress Maighdin," he growled. He was going to skin whoever had put them up this time. If stories about rebellion had spread this far . . . He faced too many complications already without adding more. "I suppose Morgase was a good queen, but we had to fend for ourselves, and we did." Abruptly he knew who she minded him of. Elayne. Not that it meant anything; he had seen men a thousand miles from the Two Rivers who could have belonged to families he knew back home. Still, she had to have some reason for anger. Her accent could be Andoran. "Things aren't as bad in Andor as you might have heard," he told her. "Caemlyn was quiet, last I was there, and Rand 
 the Dragon Reborn 
 means to put Morgase's daughter Elayne on the Lion Throne." 
Far from being mollified, Maighdin rounded on him, blue eyes blazing. "He intends to put her on the throne? No man puts a queen on the Lion Throne! Elayne will claim the throne of Andor by her right!" 
Scratching his head, Perrin wished Faile would stop watching the woman so calmly and say something. But all she did was tuck her riding gloves behind her belt. Before he could think of what to say, Lini darted in, seizing Maighdin's arm and giving her a shake fit to rattle her teeth. 
"You apologize!" the old woman barked. "This man saved your life, Maighdin, and you forget yourself, a simple country woman speaking so to a lord! Remember who you are, and don't let your tongue land you in hotter water! If this young lord was at odds with Morgase, well, everyone knows she's dead, and it's none of your affair in any event! Now apologize before he grows angry!" 
Maighdin stared at Lini, her mouth working, even more startled than Perrin. Again she surprised him, though. Instead of erupting at the white-haired woman, she slowly drew herself up, shoulders squared, and looked him in the eye. "Lini is entirely right. I have no right to speak to you so, Lord Aybara. I apologize. Humbly. And I ask your pardon." Humble? Her jaw was stubborn, her tone proud enough for an Aes Sedai, and her scent said she was ready to chew a hole in something. 
"You have it," Perrin said hastily. Which did not seem to placate her one bit. She smiled, and maybe she intended gratitude, but he could hear her teeth grinding. Were women all crazy? 
"They are hot and dirty, husband," Faile said, putting a hand in at last, "and the last few hours have been trying for them, I know. Aram can show the men where to clean themselves. I will take the women with me. I'll have damp cloths brought to wash your hands and faces," she told Maighdin and Lini. Gathering up Breane with a gesture, she began herding them toward the tent. At a nod from Perrin, Aram motioned the men to follow him. 
"As soon as you finish your wash, Master Gill, I'd like to talk with you," Perrin said. 
He might as well have made that spinning wheel of fire. Maighdin whipped around to gape at him, and the other two women froze in their tracks. Tallanvor was suddenly gripping his sword hilt again, and Balwer rose on his toes, peering over his bundle, head tilting this way then that. Not a wolf, perhaps; some sort of bird, watching for cats. The stout man, Basel Gill, dropped his belongings and leaped a foot in the air. 
"Why, Perrin," he stammered, snatching off the straw hat. Sweat made tracks in the dust on his cheeks. He bent to pick up his bundle, changed his mind and straightened again hastily. "I mean, Lord Perrin. I . . . ah . . . I thought it was you, but . . . but with them calling you lord, I wasn't sure you'd want to know an old innkeeper." Scrubbing a handkerchief across his nearly bald head, he laughed nervously. "Of course, I'll talk to you. Washing can wait a little longer." 
"Hello, Perrin," the hulking man said. With his heavy-lidded eyes, Lamgwin Dorn appeared lazy despite his muscles and the scars on his face and hands. "We heard about young Rand being the Dragon Reborn, Master Gill and me. Should have figured you'd have come up in the world, too. Perrin Aybara's a good man, Mistress Maighdin. I think you could trust him with anything you've a mind to." He was not lazy, and he was not stupid, either. 
Aram jerked his head impatiently, and Lamgwin and the other two followed, but Tallanvor and Balwer dragged their feet, casting wondering glances back at Perrin and Master Gill. Concerned glances. And at the women. Faile had them moving again, as well, though with plenty of darted looks at Perrin and Master Gill, at the men trailing Aram. Suddenly they were not so pleased at being separated. 
Master Gill mopped his forehead and smiled uneasily. Light, why did he smell afraid? Perrin wondered. Of him? Of a man tied to the Dragon Reborn, calling himself lord and leading an army, however small, threatening the Prophet. Might as well throw gagging Aes Sedai into it, too; he would take the blame for that, one way or another. No, Perrin thought wryly; nothing in that to frighten anybody. The whole lot of them were probably afraid he might murder them all. 
Trying to put Master Gill at ease, he led the man to a large oak a hundred paces from the red-and-white tent. Most of the great tree's leaves were gone and half those left were brown, but massive limbs spreading low provided a little shade, and some of the gnarled roots stood high enough to serve as benches. Perrin had used one for just that, twiddling his thumbs while camp was being set. Whenever he tried to do anything useful, there were always ten hands snatching it away from him. 
Basel Gill was not eased, however much Perrin asked after the Queen's Blessing, his inn in Caemlyn, or recalled his own visit there. But then, perhaps Gill was remembering that that visit was not the thing to calm a man, with Aes Sedai and talk of

 						Hi, it's Tim one more time... 						 						
 						Disaster looms!
Yesterday a federal court denied a plea to delay the massive increase in rates webcasters must pay the record labels. This means that, absent immediate Congressional action, the new ruinous royalty rates will be going into effect on Monday threatening the future of all internet radio. 
 						 						This is a very dire situation and I'm writing to ask one more time for your support. The effort you've made over the past four months has been extraordinary and has forced the rapid introduction of the bill, but the committee process has been sluggish and we need to once again remind the representatives of the urgency of this issue. This is perhaps the most important phone call you can make for us. 						
 						Please call your Congressional representatives in the Senate and ask them to force immediate action on the Internet Radio Equality Act and bring the bill to a vote. It is critical that their phones begin ringing off the hook starting early in the morning. If it's busy, please try again later. 						 						
 						Congressperson Jean Schmidt: (202)225-3164 						 						 						
 						Senator Sherrod Brown: (202) 224-2315
 						Senator George V. Voinovich: (202) 224-3353 						 						 						
 						I'm sorry that we have to keep asking you for this - but it's our only recourse. We are no match for the legal and legislative strength of the RIAA and we need your help. 
 						 						Thank you again.

time when I am not home make sure you checkout with another RA in order to 
avoid being billed.  If your roommate is staying for second session just 
make sure all of your items are out of the room.  Thanks.  If you have any 
questions just email me.

Hi All,
Below is the link to buy tickets to the Roller Derby competition this
Saturday at Cincinnati Gardens:
http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/16003E7EE7CC9349?artistid=1119002&majorcat
id=10004&minorcatid=102
Also, here is the Cincinnati RollerGirls link for more information:
http://www.cincinnatirollergirls.com/index.html
Hope everyone can come. The game starts at 7:30, so I am thinking we could
meet in the lobby around 7ish, unless others are interested in car pooling.
Oh yah, tickets are 10 a person, but increase to 15 the night of the game,
so I think we will buy ours in advance. I couldn't find any group rates...
Let me know if you have better luck.
Best,
Jen

Dear Ms. Plona,
We appreciate that you have taken the time to contact Cincinnati Bell

Subject: 3% Peroxide
-------------------------------------------------------
3% peroxide 
This was written by Becky Ransey of Indiana 
"I would like to tell you of the benefits of that plain little old bottle o f 3% peroxide you can get for under $1.00 at any drug store. My husband has
 been in the medical field for over 36 years, and most doctors don't tell y ou about peroxide, or they would lose thousands of dollars." 
1. Take one capful (the little white cap that comes with the bottle) and ho ld in your mouth for 10 minutes daily, then spit it out. (I do it when I ba the) 
No more canker sores and your teeth will be whiter without expensive pastes . Use it instead of mouthwash. (Small print says mouth wash and gargle righ t on the bottle) 
2. Let your toothbrushes soak in a cup of "Peroxide" to keep them free of g erms. 
3. Clean your counters, table tops with peroxide to kill germs and leave a  fresh smell. Simply put a little on your dishrag when you wipe, or spray it
 on the counters. 
4. After rinsing off your wooden cutting board, pour peroxide on it to kill
 salmonella and other bacteria. 
5. I had fungus on my feet for years - until I sprayed a 50/50 mixture of p eroxide and water on them (especially the toes) every night and let dry. 
6. Soak any infections or cuts in 3% peroxide for five to ten minutes sever al times a day. My husband has seen gangrene that would not heal with any m edicine, but was healed by soaking in peroxide. 
7. Fill a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water and keep  it in every bathroom to disinfect without harming your septic system like b leach or most other disinfectants will. 
   
8. Tilt your head back and spray into nostrils with your 50/50 mixture when ever you have a cold, or plugged sinuses. It will bubble and help to  kill  the bacteria. Hold for a few minutes then blow your nose into a  tissue. 
9. If you have a terrible toothache and cannot get to a dentist right away,
 put a capful of 3% peroxide into your mouth and hold it for ten minutes se veral times a day. The pain will lessen greatly. 
10. And of course, if you like a natural look to your hair, spray the 50/50
 solution on your wet hair after a shower and comb it through. You will not
 have the peroxide burnt blonde hair like the hair dye packages, but more n atural highlights if your hair is a light brown, reddish, or dirty blonde.  It also lightens gradually so it's not a drastic change. 
11. Put half a bottle of peroxide in your bath to help rid boils, fungus, o r other skin infections. 
12. You can also add a cup of peroxide instead of bleach to a load of white s in your laundry to whiten them. If there is blood on clothing, pour direc tly on the soiled spot. Let it sit for a minute, then rub it and rinse with
 cold water. Repeat if necessary. 
13. I use peroxide to clean my mirrors with, and there is no smearing which
 is why I love it so much for this. 
I could go on and on.  It is a little brown bottle no home should be withou t! With prices of most necessities rising, I'm glad there's a way to save t ons of money in such a simple, healthy manner. 
Send on to others who might need to know the benefits of 3% peroxide.

Really nothing has occurred since last night... so I have absolutely

Well I have a quiz for my online class this week... so I'll have to come

 Even if you think you have college costs covered for the year, you may need more!

 Tuition Answer is a simple, unsecured loan for employed parents with good credit, offered by the nation's leading provider of education funding. Best of all, it provides the flexibility you need: 
* Rates are competitive, and you can defer repayment until after graduation.** 
* It's fast--your check can be on its way to you. There are no long federal forms to fill out and you can't be turned down for making too much money. 
* The money comes directly to you, not the school. Use it for whatever your student needs--a laptop, books, fees, living expenses, study abroad, even graduate school. 
 			 			
Remember, Sallie Mae's 1-2-3 approach to paying for college makes all your funding easier. After taking advantage of scholarships and grants and low-cost federal loans, you may still need money to help you pay for school. That's when you should consider Sallie Mae's Tuition Answer Loan. 			 
Does your student have enough money to finish that degree? 
 It's easy to be sure with a Tuition Answer Loan! 			 
Apply now for extra cash for any college expense!

*Maximum loan amount and loan availability varies by school. Students are always required to sign the Tuition Answer Loan and will be obligated for repayment.
 			 **Principal and interest can be deferred for up to 4 1/2 tears while the student is continuously enrolled on at least a half-time basis plus 6 month grace period. Deferring payment while in school will result in higher fees and increase overall loan costs. Tuition Answer Loan proceeds are solely to pay for a student's qualified higher education expenses, as described in Section 221 (d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. Section 221 (d)(2), at an eligible educational institution. The expenses considered "qualified higher education expenses" may vary from school to school and may affect a student's ability to qualify for a school's financial aid program. Students seeking federal financial assistance should seek that assistance first, and then use the Tuition Answer Loan, and any other private loan proceeds for any remaining financial need gap and, if necessary to finance their expected family contribution (EFC). Students are always required to sign the Tuition Answer Loan and will be obligated for repayment.

An Announcement and Invitation

Jennifer Ellis
je267304@ohio.edu
marching110@lukepotter.com
Hey 110.  Hope your summer is going well!  
I have an announcement to make:  I'm getting married this August 18th in Flint, 
Michigan.  My fiance's name is Roy Almasy.  Some of you may remember seeing him 
at football games...he has dark hair and a scraggly beard.  We got engaged in 
February and decided on the big day in April or so.  Since then we've been hard-
core planning.  :)
I care about you kids, so I wanted to extend an invitation to you all.  I know 
it's late notice, but I'd love to see your faces!
The wedding is the day after the 2006 Marching 110 returns from down south.  
Now, after all that driving, who wouldn't want to jump in a car and drive 5 and 
a half hours to the wonderful Flint, Michigan?  But seriously, you are all 
invited.
I attached the inside of the invite, so check it out!
The wedding begins at 4pm, which would allow you to drive up that day, rather 
than the day before.
Guests are welcome to attend, so if you decide to attend, just shoot me an e-
mail and tell me who and how many are attending with you.  This will help with 
food and what not.  Once I get your RSVP e-mail I'll send you directions and 
info on a hotel(or I can find a family/college student for you to stay with).
If you have any questions, let me know.  I'd love to hear from you!
Jesus loves you

Re: this is random...
It takes me forever to email people back, lol. I can never think of enough to fill an email in one sitting, it usually takes like three.  No, I can't really see sunburn, but I think I told you that on the phone yesterday.  Also, when there's just one blinking traffic light, I can't tell if it's yellow, orange, red, or whatever colors they come in.  Any typos are a result of my phone guessing my words incorrectly.  Send me an email when you're back in the coffeeshop and I'll get online.  Today was a fun day, we played golf and putt-putt.  We should definitely play golf sometime, and putt-putt too.  In other news, I miss you too.  I think you knew that though.  Clich
 can be a good thing sometimes :-)  I'm pretty sure I'm going to come see you sometime in the two weeks after I get home (if that's alright with you, of course). Well, I think i'm going to go call you now, so I'll talk to you soon kellibean!

Shells
Good morning Kelli!  I just got back from the beach.  I found some cool shells.  I was in the middle of a dream about you when my alarm went off.  We were walking together to somewhere far away, and you had to stop and take a shower of all things.  I kissed you on the neck and said "don't be long, it's cold out here."  I'm sure that's symbolic somehow, lol.  
I miss you Kelli.  That's really why I'm sending you this.  I hope you're sleeping well, and I can't wait to see you again :-)

Hey Plona - how's it going?  Haven't heard from you in a while.  Hope you're 
enjoying the summer.  Are you going on the North Carolina trip with the 
band?  I don't think I will be, but it sounds like fun.
I'm in the process of raising the support for my upcoming ministry with 
Keynote that I told you guys about in the spring.  It's a long and slow 
process, but I'm praying God will bring in what I need!  And actually, I 
wanted to see if you would be at all interested in supporting me.  I know 
money isn't something that college students have a lot of, but I wanted to 
talk to all my friends from school to see if anyone would be interested.  I 
have to raise $2,500 in monthly support and $2,500 in one-time support, and 
a contribution toward either would be a blessing!
On the other hand, please don't feel pressured.  If giving isn't something 
you feel led to do right now, that's totally cool.  I'm just trying to give 
the opportunity to as many people as I can.  You don't have to give me a 
definite answer right away, but if you would prayerfully consider it and 
then let me know, that would be awesome.
Thanks Jonathan, and I hope to hear from you soon.  Take care, man!

Re: What's up, yo?
It's going well.  I'm in myrtle beach at the moment :-)  I'm not going on the band trip, I'll be on vacation with my mom's family that week.  How's your summer going?  I hope the support raising is going well, i'm sure it will work out for you.  You're right that as a college student I don't have a lot of money, but I'd like to contribute what I can.  I think I owe you money from our camping trip anyway, lol. Let me know how I can get that to you and I'll get it sent when I can.  Good luck with the rest of your summer and fundraising!

Hey, I'm at the coffeeshop and bored already even though I have a lot to 
do, lol. So I couldn't sleep at all last night, I went through my closet 
for about an hour and watched a show for another hour or so then just sat 
in bed for another hour, lol.  I had time to think a lot which is good I 
guess. I went through things we could do... and I think this is about the 
list I came up with...
This all depends upon when you actually arrive and leave, so you'll have to 
let me know what your plans are there.  I know you have to get back to pick 
your sister up on Sunday, but know you are welcome to spend the night if 
you want, we have a guest bedroom and everything, haha.
We could:
Go to Granville and you can see the town your parents like/I grew up in... 
but that's like 30 min. each way so yeah...
Go to Heath (which goes through Granville) but it has a pretty sweet pool 
slides/lazy river and such.
Go golfing... but that would have to be later because I think they have a 
tournament sat. but I'm not sure, but see if we go later like 7ish we can 
just go out my backyard and not have to pay, lol.
Go to the driving range
Play Euchre with my parents... but that requires my parents involvement, 
lol.
Play pool... that won't take all that long but a def. possibility
Get a movie...
ummm boche ball... any other games...
Then if you didn't want to go to Mt. Vernon...
The Ohio State Fair...
Easton...
I think that's about all I could think of... so let me know if you think of 
anything else... lol

Hey, I've got to go to the grocery store, I made my mom not leave me here 
because I want to make sure I can get food I like, haha.  But I wanted to 
say thinking about you doesn't help my dreams much either... I had a dream 
that Chloe drowned in a puddle, but then it wasn't Chloe it was some evil 
person who made a look-a-like Chloe that wasn't real.  It was really odd... 
but thinking about you does help me get to sleep, lol. I can't get over how 
sweet you are though... probably doesn't help your whole got to be manly 
thing but I like it, lol.  I'll talk to you later on tonight, have a great 
day!

Okay... so I don't really know what to say, considering I just woke up 
about 3 hours ago and I talked to you right before I went to bed and such, 
but anyway I'll be here awhile.  I have all kinds of stuff to do for school 
then my parents gave me all kinds of stuff to look up as well.  Yeah I'm 
pretty much out of small talk topics, but I am really glad you came! Oh and 
I expect a list of all those annoying things I do ASAP, lol.

3. I can't get you out of my mind (it's like one of those songs that just 
don't go away)
4. You touched the cue ball in pool!  haha
5. Your car is cooler than mine ( and your wheel protector thing-a-mahgig 
didn't fall off!)
6. You have the internet at home!
7. Did I mention that you live 2 hours away?
I'll add on when I need to but that's all I could think of right now.

Thinking about you
I was lying here thinking about you, and I wanted you to know that I like you a lot, and that's not going to change no matter how weird your emails are.  It's ok if you don't want to send it, I'm not trying to convince you, I just wanted to tell you that.  
I was always bad at transitions.  
So bad, in fact, that it seems I fell asleep in the middle of one.  I started this email last night, lol.  It's early, so I think I'm going to go back to bed.  I hope you have a wonderful day, and I'll talk to you later!

This is boring
Concourse D.  D for dumb.  There isn't even any decent food here, I had to eat at burger king, lol.  The upside is that we only have to wait for half an hour till our flight to Tallahassee (we're in Atlanta now).  Then we have a 2 hour car ride to the island.  Hopefully your day is going well, and airport free!  I will give you a call later tonight once my family settles down.  Lol, we were all really obnoxious on the plane.  That's my family!  Talk to you later!

You being obnoxious... who could imagine? My morning consisted of my mom 
waking me up like 3 times because she was bored.  So finally I got up and 
we watched a movie and then I came by myself to town because my mom wanted 
to take a nap, haha.  But anyway... yeah I'm pretty bored.  I'm going to be 
here a few min. then I'm going to walk around and check out the "music". 
I'll come back in an hour or so later. Oh by the way did you ever get the 
email I sent you yesterday? Have fun!

Haha, sounds like a fun morning.  Good luck browsing through the music, maybe you'll find something good.  I'm in the car now, and we have like an hour and a half to go.  And no, I didn't get your email yesterday.  My phone was being weird, so I thought it might be that, but I checked online and it wasn't there either.  Who knows.  Resend it if you still have it.  Don't attach a word document because I might not be able to open it.  Well hopefully I'll talk to you soon!  I'm going to get back to not enjoying my car ride, lol.

well its more like listen to random music... its the place I heard "Taylor 
the Latt
 Boy" last year. But yeah.. have fun in the car! haha... oh and 
here's the email...and I prob. shouldn't be sending you this right now... 
but oh well
	Okay so honesty is the best policy right, lol.  Oh and actually talking 
about things is also good, so anyway here it goes.  Like I said when you 
were here, I'm clueless.  I really have no idea what I am doing and how to 
do anything.  I don't know when the right time is, or how to react.  I know 
everyone has some of those feelings but not near as much as I do.  I don't 
know what is too slow, too fast, too long, too short, and so on.  It is 
like society has created so much emphasis on how everything is done, it is 
way too overwhelming.  Like the movie Hitch (yes another movie reference, 
lol), where there was a right way to do everything (granted the whole point 
was to show you should be yourself, but still).  So who knows what signals 
I'm sending you when really I have no idea tht I'm doing that, lol. 
Sometimes I feel like I am not 
 I don't know
 doing enough to show you 
that I care.  The thing is, it is just going to take me awhile, not because 
I don't like you, just because this is all new.  It has probably been 
pretty obvious that I'm slowly catching on
 slowly being a key word, 
haha.  But see for me, this is like amazing.  Well you are amazing, because 
for me just hugging someone means that I must really like them.  The point 
is that there has been a decent amount of guys who have liked me or asked 
me out (not all were completely creepy, haha, just most), but you are the 
first one that I have wanted to hug/cuddle/whatever
 The point is I guess 
I'm pretty picky, but somehow you made it through, lol, but I don't want 
the fact that I am completely inexperienced to mess it up.  And I know you 
will say that doesn't matter and such, but it has to, to some extent
	Oh and another thing (which probably should not be brought up through an 
email, 
 but leave it to me to do the unimaginable, haha)  I don't think 
this really has anything to do with the lack of experience, but maybe it 
does.  Either way, what exactly is our 'status'. Are we friends that like 
each other, still trying to figure things out
 or dating 
 or going out 
(is there a difference, I don't even know, I thought one was like 
'exclusive' and the other was just going on random dates, all the 
terminology confuses me, haha.) Or should this be something that we 
shouldn't even be thinking about and I'm just jumping to conclusions or 
something.  But whatever, you know what I mean
 There isn't a right 
answer, so don't think that I'm expecting an answer and will be all I don't 
know, weird if you don't choose that one.  Is this awkward
 because I'm 
feeling the awkwardness
 lol.
	Well anyway I hope that wasn't too weird/awkward
 but yeah it happens. 
I also hope this doesn't change anything
 well at least for the worse, 
lol.  Oh and I'll be honest again, this is a slightly revised email from 
the one I was telling you about
 it has the same points just not as much 
detail about specific events of my past, lol. I added some stuff though, so 
you know it should make up for it.  Well I'm sure this is like really 
confusing and long enough as it is, so I'm going to end it, lol.  I hope 
you are having a good day and I miss you.

You and me
This was actually a pretty good time to send me this email, lol.  I have another hour in the car with nothing to do but think and respond.  For some reason I tend to answer emails backwards, so bear with me if it's not all in the same order.
I want to start by saying that it's not awkward at all.  It's actually very refreshing to have someone tell me their feelings so honestly and plainly.  I only feel awkward when people try to dance around things.  You don't do that, it's one of the reasons I like you so much.
Remember at the end of the movie when the celebrity is talking to will smith?  She lists all of the things that made her like that guy so much, and none of them were the things that hitch told him to do.  I never have understood signals or 'dating protocol' either, it's why talking is so important to me.  I've never put much stock in the way society tells you to do things anyway.  What i'm trying to say is that whatever it is you're doing, you're doing it well.  I never feel awkward or weird when i'm with you.
I don't want you to worry about not doing enough.  I've known you long enough to be able to tell.  Truthfully, there was a time that I wondered if maybe I was imagining it, but just the fact that you were 'catching on' as you put it convinced me that you do.  When you stand close to me, or hold my hand, or anything, I know that that's new for you and a big deal, and it tells me that you care enough to show affection in a way that you're not used to.  
Hey, whaddya mean I "somehow made it through"???  Somehow?  I made it through because I'm awesome!!!!   Lol.  I'm glad that I did.  Somehow.
As far as our status, I don't really know either.  That's something else I never learned about.  I think we're 'indefinite' until we talk about it and decide something, which seems to be right now.  I think you're right about the difference between dating and going out, although I've never been able to date more than one person at a time.  We can be whatever you want us to be, but I think we're going out.  My mom's been calling you my girlfriend for a couple weeks now, lol, I didn't really know what to say to that because we hadn't talked about it.  
Anyways, I'm glad you emailed me.  I was thinking about some of the same things myself, but I didn't know how to bring them up.  I hope I answered everything, and I hope that I did a good job of explaining.  Let me know if I need to explain anything or if you have any questions about anything.  I care about you a lot, and I want you to know that I think you're wonderful.  You really are different in a good way.  I'll talk to you soon, Kellibean!

Haha
 or maybe rather, what am I going to do
 Well anyway, I'm glad the 
email wasn't awkward and I think you pretty much answered/responded 
perfectly, haha.  I know exactly what you mean with not being able to date 
more than one person at a time, well at least I could never think about 
doing that since it's obviously never really been an issue for me, haha. 
But anyway I guess what I am trying to say is that I am more than happy to 
call you my boyfriend if you are cool with that.  I really like the fact 
that you understand me so well, or at least it seems that way, haha.  It's 
really nice to not have to worry about the stupid stuff so many people care 
so much about.  Well I spent basically all day at this festival and it was 
pretty fun.  I heard a vocal major that is a senior at Bowling Green sing 
Phantom of the Opera stuff which was really amazing.  Then there were these 
cute little kids dancing.  Then there was this boy, he was probaabout 
7, and he did jazz and tap.  He was really good and I was really impressed. 
He was one of those kids who could just sell anything, lol.  Rachel called 
and I talked to her awhile, then I went home for a couple hours and now am 
back.  My parents and two couples from the golf league are meeting us up 
here for a concert at 9:30
 some band they are all really excited about 
and I have never heard of before.  So it should be fun.  Who knows if you 
get this or not considering the fact you don't really have service, haha. 
But hope you are having fun!  I'll talk to you later,

Haha, it turns out I have service if I stand on the deck.  Sort of.  Enough to send an email anyway, I don't know how well it'll do voice.  
I'm glad that we understand each other so well.  I'm not sure how to describe exactly what I'm feeling right now, but it's a very happy feeling :-)
I would love for you to call me your boyfriend, and for me to call you my girlfriend.  Should we put it on facebook?  Lol.  
It sounds like you had a much more interesting day than I did.  Mine consisted of travel and dinner.  
Well, I think I'm going to call you now, lol.  Talk to you soon!

Hey... I'm in the coffee shop.. and there is this girl playing and she's 
fairly good, but anyway I'm the only one listening ... well sort of 
listening considering I am on my computer.  And she keeps talking to me... 
and its kind of weird, haha.  But anyway, facebook... oh facebook... I 
don't care, lol.  I think it's kind of weird when people put all of that 
stuff on with names and stuff because then everyone in the world know 
exactly when anything and everything happens... but that's just me.  I 
never put anything on the 'status' section on facebook for that reason, but 
I'll leave that one up to you, haha.  Well we came and listened to a 
Christian band, then ate... so now whenever my parents come back I think 
its off to watch the golf tournament.  Yay for the golf tournament where 
Tiger is like 5 shots ahead and it basically isn't even a competition 
anymore... can't you tell how excited I am.  Well I'll be here a little bit 
if you happen to get this instantaneously, lol.  If not I'll talk to you 
later, hope the beach is nice!

ooooo I forgot something... okay so I don't know if I ever told you about 
Erin... but I will now if I hadn't.  My parents have these friends (Chris 
and Tim) and they have a daughter (Erin) who is going to be a Freshman at 
OU this year.  Well I'm not a very big fan of any of them.  Actually I 
really really don't like them, haha.  But anyway guess where Erin is 
living... oh yes, Perkins... how much does that suck.  My dad golfed with 
Tim yesterday and I guess he told him that.  So that's really going to suck 
and I'm sure Chris and Tim will come up for some game or something and 
blah...
And then another weird thing... last night I went and got a cookie from the 
coffeeshop right.  Well it became a big deal because the girl couldn't get 
it out of the container... but anyway these two older guys were either 
drunk or just really weird, but anyway they kept talking to me about how 
crazy they are.  Well anyway.. it was weird, well today this guy stopped 
and asked if they had wireless here, and i'm like yeah.. and hes like oh 
you were here last night and started talking to me again.. i'm like ummm 
weird, haha.
Okay i'm done now, haha... I've got to go because my dad is all anxious to 
get back to the golf, haha.  I'll ttyl

Re: Bad service here
Sounds like fun.  I read about tiger's almost record-setting round in the paper yesterday.  They should make a special tee just for him.  The silver tees or something.  Who's in second?
I agree with you about facebook, it is a little weird.  It still has me listed as single though, and looking for a relationship, lol.  I've already found one, and I'm not looking for another.  So I think I'm going to unlist myself as single.
I hope you're enjoying yourself in the coffeeshop!  Talk to you later!

So I have reached a new low... I'm stealing Internet from a hotel now... 
this is sad.   Not that it really matters anymore but Woody was in second 
for awhile and then Ernie Ells.  Everyone was kind of rooting for either 
one of them because Woody hasn't ever been in the top 10 finishing on a 
major and then Ernie just recovered from tearing his acl tubing with his 
family.  So yeah Tiger won, but I like Tiger so it's all good.  My mom is 
turning her resume in at this place so that's why I'm stealing the Internet 
from here today, lol.  I'm bored... I just want to take this stupid final 
and be done with the online class and go back to school... come on two 
weeks, haha.  Hope you are having a good day... I'll talk to you later.

My mom's flipping out because she doesn't know whose house tess is at to for under.  I think we're renting bikes later, so that should be fun.  Well i'm going to go, have a great day!

I'm tired... I don't want to take this stupid quiz... and yet I have to.  I 
think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, haha.  No, not really.  I 
decided to come to the library this time, and it's kind of weird because 
there are a bunch of old men working on their computers here and I'm like 
hmmmm which one doesn't belong, haha.  Nothing really has happened since I 
last talked to you, but just thought I'd say hey.  Oh and I looked up 
online different things to do at the beach, and I found a list of 21 things 
to do. I personally enjoy number 6, 7, and 15... I demand pictures, haha. 
Hope you are finding some things to do.  I'll ttyl.
~Kelli~
Things to do at the Beach
1. Re-enact the D-Day landings.
2. Build a sandcastle and stand guard next to it, every hour, do the 
'changing of the guard' throwing in the occasional "HALT, WHO GOES, 
THERE?!?!?"
3. Go in to the sea with a lilo and about half an hour later, climb out 
looking disorientated and say loudly in an Australian accent " CRIKEY 
COBBER'S, I WAS AT BONZAI BEACH AN HOUR AGO!! MUSTA FALLEN ASLEEP ON ME 
LILO!!"
4. (An old, but still funny one!) Whilst in the sea, start thrashing about 
and scream "SHARKS!!!" . Ten minutes later, do it again.
5. (Affective if you're a man). Wear a tight, red swimming costume and run 
in slow motion in the style of Baywatch, whilst running, flick your hair in 
an appealing manner.
6. Wear a Penguin costume, climb out the sea puffing and panting, look 
around and say loudly " OH CRAP! TOOK A WRONG TURNING SOMEWHERE!" go back 
in to the sea and start swimming away.
7. Bury a hose with water spraying upwards, Tell everyone you dug down to 
deep and now the beach is sinking.
8. Stagger up the beach in old ripped clothes clutching a matchstick and 
tell everyone that this is all that is left of your ship.
9. Follow the tide when it leaves and find out where it goes.
10. Practice your ostrich impressions.
11. With some friends, sit in a dinghy wearing German army uniforms, paddle 
along the shore line and announce" VE TOOK ZE WRONG TURNING, I OPE ZAT VE 
ARE NOT TOO LATE".
12. with a friend, sing Summer Lovin' in pure Grease style.
13. Dig a hole in the sand and hide in it, when the beach is full, climb 
out and wearing a prisoners uniform and say "OH, THIS IS'NT MEXICO!!", look 
back down the hole and say" GO BACK LADS, WE SHOULD HAVE GONE LEFT INSTEAD 
OF RIGHT!"
14. Have a pebble fight.
15. As the coastguard goes by with his siren on, run along after it happily 
shouting "ICECREAM MAN! ICECREAM MAN!"
16. Pretend to be a crab, go ahead and nip people.
17. Wear a pirates costume, get someone to dig a hole and say "ARGH ME 
MATEY'S, WE SHALL BURY THE TREASURE HERE!" and proceed to bury some 
chocolate coins.
18. Whilst using a pair of binoculars, suddenly shout" IVE FOUND IT!!, 
ATLANTIS HAS ARISEN!! ISNT IT BEAU......NO HOLD ON, SORRY MY MISTAKE, IT'S 
THE ISLE OF WHITE, SORRY!"
19. Go around and tell everyone that you have to 'Pay and Display' to use 
the beach, insist you are the ticket person. Charge a ridiculous amount.
20. Beforehand, place a piece of bloodied meat on the edge of the sea, 
later go around and ask if anyone has seen your doggie. Say he was playing 
in the water when you heard someone say SHARKS and you haven't seen him 
since.
21. Eat sand.

Happy Friday!
Haha, thanks for the list.  I had trouble finding a penguin costume though.  
Today's our last day, so we're trying to finish as much of the food we bought as we can.  We're having sandwiches for dinner and stuff like that.  We have to leave here tomorrow at like 9:30 or so, so I have to get up early.  I've been getting up early anyway though, so it won't be so bad. 
I always find myself thinking of you when I'm lying in bed.  Maybe that's why I dream of you sometimes.  I had a dream about you last night.  We were sitting in a hot tub, but people kept coming in and bothering us.  Then my sister started making breakfast, so I woke up, lol.  
Well, I'm going to go down to the beach, have a great day kellibean!

Well with you in the house it shouldn't be all that difficult to finish up 
the food you guys brought, lol.  I got up early and picked Mandy up... she 
needed to go by the band which took us way out of the way and then we went 
to lunch.  But she enjoyed it.  I found out that her dance was a down 
syndrome conference so that's pretty cool.  It went well though... So now 
I'm in Granville and trying to stay low so that no one sees me... I don't 
want to be noticed in this town, haha.  But see I remembered to get the 
number to call for Lancasters campus so there! So I guess I'll head home 
and then the golfing thing is tonight, but I don't know if I'll go or not. 
Have a good last day! I'll talk to you later.

Hey there Jonathan, 
I was looking at the St. George pictures yesterday and thought I would drop you an email of encouragement (oh no, here it comes
). I know a lot of people have been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD and with the right dose of medication they feel better and live more productive lives. I know I sound like an infomercial for a drug company but it
s the truth. Did you know all 4 of Blake and Craig
s kids (Meg, Bess, Reed, Nate) have some form of ADD and have been on medicine for years? Yes in deedy doo that is surely true. 
Anyway, I
m emailing you to encourage you to try some different medications that are available for you and find one that feels right. Since you don
t drink or smoke, anything you put in your body will feel especially weird right off the bat but you
ll find something you can live with and that makes you feel better and learn better. Nuff said 
 lecture is over. 
And of course, if you ever need anything or want someone to talk to other than your parents you certainly know that Aunt Eleano is always available. It was great to see you last weekend and to meet your adorable girlfriend. 
Have fun and study hard! 
Aunt Eleano

Being a certified computer technician for many years, I know the importance of keeping your computer clean. But what you may not know is you also have to clean the inside of your monitor. Yes, the inside. Many times people forget that these things are not sealed and small particles of dust can accumulate on the inside of your screen. Now, there's a link to a site on the internet that can clean your screen. Click on the link below to launch this application.

If any clarinets or altos are missing music, I found a few music binders 
Friday night at Peden after we handed out uniforms. I also found a pair of 
pants (I think they're Reebok?). These items are currently living in my car; 
if you think they might be yours let me know and I'll bring them to practice 
on Tuesday.

Discoveries to Sample at ArkivMusic
Me
Jonathan.plona@gmail.com
President@ArkivMusic.com
Dear Mr. Plona, 
A small investment yields delightful discoveries this week at ArkivMusic <http://www.arkivmusic.com/home> .
Naxos CDs <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007>  were $5.99 when the label launched 20 years ago, and (for 
a limited time) they're the same price today.* Over the years, the label's 
catalog of bargains on basic repertoire has yielded to an explosion of 
exciting music that cries out to be heard. We've plucked a handful of 
such releases, each now with sound samples, which are likely to be 
 <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007> new discoveries for you: 
*  Meredith Willson: Symphonies 1 & 2 <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Willson>  ($5.99) -- Best known for 
 writing The Music Man for Broadway, Meredith Willson was, 
 in fact, born in Iowa and played flute for John Philip Sousa's own 
 band before joining the New York Philharmonic. His many orchestral 
 works include the score for Charlie Chaplin's film The Great 
 Dictator and these two wonderful Symphonies. 
*  Donostia: Piano Music <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Donostia>  ($5.99) -- Jordi Mas
 brings this music to 
 life with splendid panache. Donostia's expertise lies in his 
 native Basque folk-music; his musical style blossomed in Paris 
 during the 1920's. The keyboard works draw upon the more whimsical 
 side of his contemporaries Debussy and Ravel, as well as Chabrier's 
 effervescent keyboard writing, Grieg's rustic lyricism, and Faur
's 
 linear refinement. 
*  Henry Hadley: The Ocean, Symphony No 4 <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Hadley>  ($5.99) -- Henry Hadley 
 was the first conductor of the San Francisco Symphony and later 
 founded the Berkshire Music Festival. His music ranges from 
 impressionist to post-romantic styles: The Ocean is as atmospheric 
 as its title suggests, displaying Hadley's skill at evocative
 orchestration. In the Symphony No. 4, the four movements act as a 
 musical compass, describing the four regions of the globe. 
*  English String Miniatures <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007English>  ($5.99) -- There are so many gems in 
 this genre, and in this volume Naxos juxtaposes a few familiar 
 ones from Holst and Finzi, with some captivating discoveries by 
 Carlo Martelli, Michael Hurd, and William Blezard. You simply 
 must have a listen. 
*  Garc
a De Salazar: Complete Vespers Of Our Lady <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Garcia>  ($5.99) -- 
 Precious few works survive of this leading liturgical composer 
 of the Spanish Baroque. The music "often takes a thrilling verve 
 and resplendency" and the performances are outstanding. 
There are many more to discover in our Naxos Adventures <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007>  section, but 
of course Naxos continues to deliver exemplary  <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007NR> new releases each month 
as well. Two highly enjoyable releases of Arthur Sullivan <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Sullivan>  and Stokowski  <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Stokowski> transcriptions are just out! Don't miss our 20 favorites <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Favorites>  from the last 
20 years as well, as we continue to celebrate the Naxos 20th anniversary 
this month. The Naxos complete <http://www.arkivmusic.com/Discoveries1007Naxos>  catalog is all just $5.99 per disc for a 
limited time!
As always, I thank you for your support and love of Classical Music.

In an attempt to hurry the process along of getting you your sweatshirts and long sleeved blacks I would 
like to have all order forms in by the end of Wednesday's practice. Another option I will give you is to 
contact our PR representative via email--bl234803@ohio.edu--and just tell her your name and size and 
obviously what you are ordering. This will save you having to find me after practice and also save us paper 
shuffling.
Whichever option works best for you is fine with me. We will be going to the store to order them on 
Thursday though so I would recommend simply emailing your order in after you read this so you don't 
forget. No money will be due until delivery and unlike spats gloves and shoes you will NOT be getting 
these items until you pay.
On that note will those individuals who still owe me money please bring it by the end of the this week and 
YES the new spats will be in soon so you can get your shiny new pair.
Any questions please let me know.

Dear Jonathan, 
Those pictures are really cute. You are starting to look really old. Like a real live grown-up. I don't know how I feel about that. 
Not that I should talk, because I'm not opposed to dating 24 year olds. :-P 
I feel like the only people on my level here are married or not interested in dating. It's not so good. I can't really seem to find them just as friends, either. 
I'm sorry I was being so silly on the phone. I'm glad that you know me well enough that that's ok. 
Say a prayer for me, because I'm a little bit homesick. 
Thank you for everything that you've done for me. I was thinking today as I was putting my bass away how different my life would be without you. I don't think I would've even started playing bass, and I certainly would not have stuck with it. That's just one of a million things, but you know what I mean. Anyways, I have a 7:45 class and a million hours of homework to do. Goodnight, good luck, and call me if you need anything!

Re:
I don't know how I feel about looking old either, lol.  This fall, I came back and had a two week beard and long hair, and my friend said I looked like I was 30.  And he graduated last year.  
Oh well.  My hair isn't gray yet, and my Weiner still works.  That's what's important, right?  By the way, I didn't capitalize that, my phone did.  I'm leaving it because I think it deserves a capital letter.
I had the same experience when I came here.  You're somebody smart floating in a sea of dum.  But once you float long enough to find a smart person, he or she will have connections to other smart persons, and life will be good.
The homesickness will go away.
Good luck with your early class!
Jonathan
P.S. I think you owe me a few pictures still ;-).  I'd like them before the end of the week please.

     please propose a time so we can synchronize.

Hey Jonathan,
Be at the Bengals practice field next to the stadium at 1:30.  Have  
your blacks on, along with your hat.  Have your uniform in a garment  
bag.
Drive safely,
Dr. Suk

Message from Provost Krendl

Executive Vice President and Provost Kathy A. Krendl

Dear Ohio University Students:
One of the unique characteristics of Ohio University is that 
each generation of students renews the question of how to be 
a university citizen.  In his recent letter to you, 
President McDavis mentioned the tenor of the times when he 
was an undergraduate in the 1970s.  But if you were to talk 
to a graduate of the 1950s, 1930s or, were it possible the 
1890s, you would find that concerns about freedoms, 
privileges, and responsibilities inherent in being a student 
have surfaced constantly.   That students in 2007 are once 
again engaged in discussion of their institutional role 
harkens back to a fundamental tradition of the campus.   
Students at other institutions, which I will refrain from 
identifying, rarely demonstrate the level of involvement and 
concern for social justice that manifests itself on our 
campus.  I am proud that many of you want to be active and 
constructive citizens of this institution.  
But constructive citizenship also entails the recognition 
that a particular voice or sentiment cannot always hold sway 
nor can we simply "vote" our way out of issues that confront 
us.  As much as we might like to be a world unto ourselves, 
we cannot be.  Ohio University is a complicated entity that 
must meet demands placed upon it by the state and the 
federal government.  Sometimes what is imposed from outside 
conflicts with the honorable purposes that we consider to be 
fundamental to our role as a university.  Idealism should 
not be sacrificed, but we cannot sustain our idealism unless 
it is thoroughly grounded in knowledge.  James Madison, who 
knew a thing or two about idealism and the importance of 
knowledge, once wrote that liberty and learning are "both 
best supported when leaning each on the other."  
In furtherance of the goal of connecting liberty and 
learning, I have suggested in meetings with students that we 
experiment with "action-oriented" conversations.   Some 
students, interested in following up on this approach, have 
asked me clarify what I mean.  For me, an action-oriented 
conversation begins with learning.  Interested participants 
make a commitment to learn about the issue intensively by 
reading and discussing together the knowledge that matters 
most.  The model that I am proposing is not of my own 
invention.  Ohio University was one of only 27 institutions 
in the nation selected to participate in the Ford 
Foundation's "Difficult Dialogues" program.   The aims of 
that program are to construct ways in which sensitive 
subjects can be thoroughly discussed in a "spirit of open 
scholarly inquiry, academic freedom and with respect for 
different viewpoints."  On our campus, students enrolled in 
the "Difficult Dialogues" program acquire knowledge and then 
use it to engage in meaningful conversations.   
I welcome your thoughts at <mailto:provost@ohio.edu> on the 
value of using action-oriented conversations as a way to 
further active and constructive university citizenship. 
Sincerely,
Kathy A. Krendl
Executive Vice President and Provost

Subject: Re: My B-day Thank-you
Thank you all - a little belated - for my B-day lunch and the lovely cards and gifts. 
 I am glad and honored that each of you attended. 
 Some of you wrote and had your picture taken in a B-day memory journal Jamie was kind enough to put together at the party. For those of you who couldn't attend Jodi's party - please write in the journal - even if it's just to say Hi and sign your name. 
 For those who did write - thank-you for your heartfelt sentiments - it truly touched me.
 When I'm 80 and drooling on the pages - it will be a kick to read. I can brag to the old farts in the "home" that I have awesome friends who are kind and beautiful a

Remember, tour T-shirt orders forms are due by tomorrow. I do not have the

Room Change Meetings
jp354706@ohio.edu
housing@ohio.edu
housing@ohio.edu
The residence hall room change period officially begins 
Sunday, October 28, with in-hall room change meetings.  Each 
building/complex will hold individual meetings.  Please 
check the bulletin boards in your halls for the location and 
time.
A campus-wide change meeting will be held at the South Pole 
(underneath Nelson Dining Hall) on October 31, at 9 PM.  
Changes are made on a first-come, first-served basis.  If 
you are unable to attend either meeting due to a class or 
work conflict, a friend may act as a proxy.  He/she will 
need to attend the meeting with your University ID and a 
note with your signature requesting a room change.
If you are living in a double/triple/quad that is not at 
full occupancy, please prepare the space for a new roommate. 
 You will not receive any further notice before a roommate 
moves in with you.
Please remember not all rooms are air conditioned.  If you 
are making a move and need air conditioning, make sure the 
room you're interested in has air conditioning.  
If you're an upperclass student with a computer or printer 
in your room, the computer and printer will not move with 
you.  We are no longer taking requests for computers or 
printers to be installed in the rooms.  Therefore, if you 
currently have a computer or printer and want to keep one, 
you must select a room that has one already installed.  The 
Residence Life staff can help you to identify which rooms 
are equipped with computers.

Dear family and friends,
It's been a long time since I sent out one of these life updates! I hope everything is going well for all of you. The semester here at BYU is already more than halfway over and mom is already asking for Christmas lists! I am very excited for the upcoming Thanksgiving break. I need it. Nat and I are planning on going up to Idaho to spend some time with Grammie and other family up there. We will be back at BYU for the Utah game though!! (FYI: BYU and University of Utah are huge rivals; it's always the best game of the year.) 
Because I only have a few minutes before I'm meeting a friend for lunch, here are the biggest/most interesting things going on in my life right now:
1. I am planning on majoring in Human Development and am still getting my minor in Spanish. I will be applying soon to go on Study Abroad to Madrid next fall. I am reeeeeally excited about that! One of my roommates is at a similar place in her Spanish classes, so she is applying to go too. We are both planning on blowing our entire life savings in a matter of four months on doing anything and everything we want to in Europe. :-) It should be a blast. And a great learning experience too.
2. I am in my second semester working at the Boys and Girls Club in Provo. I'm still working in the after school program over the 2nd grade class. This semester has been running a lot more smoothly than last semester because there are now two staff for the entire second grade instead of me by myself. Which makes my life much easier on days when we have more than 30 kids! Our girls are sweet and our boys are crazy, but we love them and have a great time. I don't think I could have a more rewarding job. It's amazing to see how the kids progress and mature and how much the Club has a positive influence on them. 
3. I also work as a Writing Fellow on campus--I work with a specific class on two of their course papers. I have 15 students whose papers I read and respond to, and then I conference with them. (Sorry mom, conference is now a verb.) The goal of Writing Fellows is to teach them to be better writers in general and in their specific discipline. I know it probably doesn't sound very exciting, but the other Writing Fellows are all fabulous people and I have a good time. And yes, I do enjoy reading papers! 
4. I love where I live and the ward that I moved into. (At BYU, since there are so many LDS students, we are grouped into "wards" by geographical boundaries and that is who we go to church with. Many social activities revolve around doing things with those in your ward.) I am rooming with three girls from my ward last year and two other girls who already lived in the apartment when the four of us moved in. The other two girls are great and we get along well--besides for a few minor annoyances, we haven't had any roommate problems! The people in our complex are way down-to-earth and just fun, good people. We love the girls that live next door and have become really good friends with an apartment of guys in our ward. 
5. Last weekend it was one of my roommate's birthdays, so the four of us (Anna, Amanda, Kendra and I--we're the ones who knew each other from last year) went shopping at one of the nice malls near Salt Lake. It was so fun to get out of Provo and go out to eat. It was nice to spend time together since we have all been really busy this semester and it's rare that all four of us are together and without anyone else. Then we went to a Haunted Corn Maze with some guys from our apartment complex. The corn maze itself was kind of lame, but still, we had a good time. 
6. I know this is what everyone really wants to know, so no, I am not currently dating anyone in particular. Just having fun and dating different guys. :-)
Well, I'm now going to be late to lunch. I'll send a few pictures from this semester later. Hope you all had a Happy Halloween! 
Love,
Stella

Hey guys,
Since we won't be having band on Monday, Thursday, and Friday, I'd like to ask
everyone who is willing to help with the senior story to come to Pruitt at the
normal time we'd have band practice. It's not like you have any other
commitments at that time, right? I need as many people as possible (excluding
freshmen [sorry guys]) to show up. You don't necessarily have to act, I need
plenty of extras as well. Come prepared to dress like you would for band camp
(it shouldn't take a ton of time, but if it's too cold or if it rains, we'll
relocate to the School of Music to film some stuff we need there). 
Also, I especially need Josh Boyer, Drew O'Bryan, Jake Young, Bridget Daugherty,
Darryl Baker, Iesha Leonard, Zach Bender, Danielle Capriato, and Erica Jenkins
to be there. I'll try to get a hold of you guys earlier so you can look over the
script. 
It should be a lot of fun and you'll all get to see the finished product at band
banquet, so come be a part of the fun! 5:00 like usual. Seriously, I know you
don't have any class conflicts!

Dear all,
A couple of things.  Actually four.
1) Need volunteers for Friday's basketball game.  Please email me.
2) Need volunteers to play in the stands at the OU - Miami football  
game on Sat., Nov. 24.  Report time will be 1:30 p.m.  I will pass a  
signup sheet at band this week.
3) This week:  rehearsal on Tue. and Wed., 5:00 - 6:00.  We'll touch  
on things we need to rehearse and learn Chop Suey!
4) Plan on departing for Columbus for the Palace Theatre concert at  
1:00 p.m. next Tue., Nov. 13.  It's important that we all go up early  
so we can rehearse (since it will have been 6 days since the last time  
we played) and drive on there is a bit different.
Richard Suk, Ed.D.
Director, Ohio University Marching Band

Hey guys!
Hope you're enjoying your day off. 
A couple of you have approached me or Luke about ordering a band photo package. If you'd like to order 
photos I am about to do a second order. 
Meet me after practice on Tuesday and I will write your name and your order down and the prints will be 
ordered as soon as possible. 
Each package includes 1 8X10, 4 4X6's, and 4 Wallets. You can also order buttons. One package is now 
$30.00 and buttons are still $5.00. If you have already ordered photos but would like to order more 
buttons, you may also do this on Tuesday. Please bring your money or checks with you...no orders are 
accepted unless you have paid. 
Group shots (last week's dimond ohio) will be delivered at a later date. 
Thanks! See you all tomorrow.

Hello Jonathan,
Thanks for taking the time to send me your thoughts and the article.  I did 
get to the second page and read the entire article.
It really concerns me that you don't expect me to take your message 
seriously and that you have little faith in all administrators.  I feel 
that you are unfair in your assessment by lumping together all 
administrators.  If you have had negative experiences with all 
administrators then I can certainly understand your point of view but I am 
not sure that it is the case.  I work hard everyday to make life better for 
students and I will continue doing so because it is the reason why I 
entered the student affairs profession.
Please know that we do not turn over student information to the RIAA unless 
we are ordered by the court to do so.  As the VP for Student Affairs, I 
agree with you that it is my duty to defend the rights of students but I 
will not protect students if they are violating the law as it currently 
exists.  Any time that students are within the rules/requirements of the 
law, I will be the first person in line to protect them.
Your message indicates that you depend on filesharing for bittorent.  It is 
my understanding that we have a process that allows for this to happen.  I 
have copied our CIO, Mr. Brice Bible for his input to verify this for us.
Again, I applaud your effort in reaching out to me and I appreciate it more 
than you know because most students only complain to each other instead of 
seeking a solution.
Perhaps we can meet to seek better ways of understanding each other's point 
of view because it seems as though we both want Ohio University to be the 
best that it can be.

Jonathan,
I was aware of the Oregon approach to RIAA prelitigation letters and certainly respect their approach. However, in the event that RIAA sues Oregon to name the students, they have no choice but to turn over all students with access to the designated IP addresses. In the OU case, we elected to let the students know immediately that their names might be required from OU if the subpoena is upheld. Neither VP Smith nor I wanted to withhold this info from the students. We never, however, provided student names to the RIAA without legal subpoena.
As for bittorrent for linux, we do not block this activity.  Only clearly illegal copyright material are blocked. I have not received a single student complaint for blocking legal activities such as linux updates.
Please let me know if you are aware of any cases where legitimate p2p was blocked.
Thanks,
Brice

Band -
After the concert this Thursday, (around 10 o'clock)the men of Phi Mu Alpha 
Sinfonia will be going around campus and uptown to give impromptu serenades 
to the Thursday night revelers.
We are inviting any man who wishes to come with us, in order to get to know 
the Brothers, and also to get an idea of some of the things we do.
We will meet in the School of Music 4th floor lobby, and go over some of 
our songs.  From there, we will set out to sing.  Don't worry about singing 
ability, we're just out to have some fun!
If you have any questions, feel free to respond to this email, or ask Ken 
Will or myself in person.
Sincerely,
Joe Kuhlman
President, Alpha Kappa Chapter
Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity of America, Inc.

Hey Band,
Just a reminder:  unless you plan on bringing money by B2 before Friday
afternoon, today's rehearsal is your last chance to pay for Clam Fest.  This
isn't like Hairy Buff where you can pay at the door- we need your money ahead of
time to make the party happen.  So please bring your $12 to indoor today, and
I'll see you there.

Prof. Kelsey,
Just a reminder that we were going to fill in my midterm and quiz6 scores with the score calculated from my final exam.  Also, I turned in projects 1 and 2 together with project 3.  If you can't locate them let me know and I'll bring another copy in on Tuesday.

Fw: The Bottle of Wine
<Undisclosed-Recipient:;>
Dick Hall
rhall1@cinci.rr.com
THE BOTTLE OF WINE 
 For all of us who are married, were married, wish 
you were married, or wish you weren't married, this 
is something to smile about the next time you see a 
bottle of wine: 
Sally was driving home from one of her business 
trips in Northern Arizona when she saw an elderly 
Navajo woman walking on the side of the road. 
As the trip was a long and quiet one, she stopped 
the car and asked the Navajo woman if she would like 
a ride. 
With a silent nod of thanks, the woman got into 
the car. 
 Resuming the journey, Sally tried in vain to make 
a bit of small talk with the Navajo woman. The old 
woman just sat silently, looking intently at 
everything she saw, studying every little detail, 
until she noticed a brown bag on the seat next to 
Sally. 
'What in bag?' asked the old woman. 
Sally looked down at the brown bag and said, 'It's 
a bottle of wine. I got it for my husband.' 
The Navajo woman was silent for another moment or 
two. 
 Then speaking with the quiet wisdom of an elder, 
she said: 
'Good trade.'

Dear all,
Here are some reminders about tomorrow:
1) Report to Peden at 1:00.  Buses will leave at 1:15. Bring uniform  
(no hats or gloves) and instrument.
2) Wear nice clothes.  If you are dancing, wear your band shoes.
3) Bring your music.  We need to review as well and go through Chop  
Suey.  Take the time this evening to look over the stuff you're iffy on.
4) Bring some meal $$.  You will have approximately a 2 hour break for  
dinner, from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.  It may be crowded in downtown  
Columbus, so be sure you get into a restaurant right away.
5) If you have tickets to leave at Will Call, bring them and give them  
to Iesha.  Place them in an envelope and write the last name first,  
then first name on the envelope.  If you don't have an envelope, Iesha  
will have some.
6) Check TONIGHT to make sure you have your uniform in order.  In the  
past we have had people show up without pants, capes, etc.  Don't be  
that person!
See you tomorrow!
Dr. Suk

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><flushleft>110,
With the end of the season comes the task of turning in your uniform (and all the extra jackets, shoulder nests, and other parts that you may have). Since we have no post-season commitments we will be turning in uniforms before you leave for Thanksgiving break. Since we are obviously getting ready to start finals the uniform staff is providing 2 opportunities for you to turn in your uniform. Thursday (11/15) from 6-8pm and Saturday (11/17) from 11am-1pm at the equipment room. If you cannot make it to one of these I need to know A.S.A.P.You will be turning in everything so don't forget your hats & plumes! 
Section leaders make sure that if you had members of your section quit before the end of the season I need their uniforms as well.
Any questions please contact me,
good luck on finals!

2007 Season DVD's

Band,
Tomorrow night at Banquet I will have order forms for the 2007 Season 
DVD.  Once again this year, they will be only $10 each, so get a DVD to 
remember the year by.  This DVD will contain each home halftime 
performance, one pre-game performance (OU vs. Temple), the Virginia Tech 
performance, and the Bengals performance.  I'll have to look through all 
the footage I have, so there may be some other things worth 
remembering.  The DVD's are primarily pre-order only, as there are a 
limited number of extra copies made.  It is preferred that you pay when 
you give me your order, so I'm not fronting the money hoping you'll be 
good on your word and pay me.  You can pay by cash or check tomorrow 
night, or you can always send me your order over break to the address 
listed in the roster (and on the OU name directory).  I'm going to make 
the deadline for orders *December 14th.  *That way I can get the order 
placed and should have them ready to give out when we return from break. 
So, bring $10 tomorrow night if you would like to order the 2007 Season DVD!
-Josh Boyer
PS:  I also have several of the 2006 DVD's left over.  I will bring some 
tomorrow night, and maybe we can strike a deal if you want to get both 
the '06 and '07 DVD's!

I'm about to purchase a cell phone that uses
tri-band GSM (900/1800/1900 MHz).  I believe that Cincinnati Bell's main
coverage area uses the 1900 MHz band, but I am not sure for other
locations.  Would it be possible to get a map of coverage by frequency?
The other specific area in question is Athens, Ohio, but I do travel a 
bit
and would like to know if I can purchase this phone.  Thanks.

Dear Mr. Plona,
Thank you for contacting Cincinnati Bell Wireless.  
I would be happy to address this for you. As previously mentioned 
wireless equipment purchased with dual-band, tri-band and quad-band can 
be used nationwide without frequency problems. We do not offer a 
coverage map by band used. I would also like to mention that all 
wireless providers phones are manufactured to work on that specific 
carriers network.  Phones can only be unlocked with a specific unlock 
code which may be obtained from the manufacturer.
Using an unlocked phone that was intended for use with another provider 
will limit your ability to receive technical assistance with the phone 
if needed.  We also will not be able to provide support for features 
such as voice mail or text messaging and more if there was a problem in 
the future.
SpinVox is an exciting new service that converts your voicemail messages
to text and delivers them straight to your mobile phone as a text 
message. There's no need to dial in to pick up your messages, you just 
read them on screen. No matter where you are or what you're doing, 
you'll never miss an important message again!  There are four great 
packages:
SpinVox Lite (25 conversions for $4.99); SpinVox Ultra (55 conversions 
for $9.99); and SpinVox Mega (100 conversions for $14.99). Any 
conversions in addition to those included in your plan are billed at 
$0.22/conversion. There is also a new unlimited option for only $19.99.

If you would like to add this feature, please respond to this email and 
I will be happy to add the feature for you.
Text messaging is a great way to save on your airtime. We offer many 
text-messaging packages. The current package you have on wireless number
513-460-5432 is free for all incoming messages with a charge of $0.15 
per outgoing message.  I have included a list of the packages we offer 
for you to review.
1. 500 outgoing messages for $4.99/month. ($0.15/message if you exceed 
500 sent messages)
2. Unlimited messages for $14.99/month.
3. Unlimited Family Text Messaging for $5.00/month for each line

------------------------
In my previous email I may have failed to mention that this is the kind 
of
tri-band commonly sold in europe (900/1800/1900 MHz) instead of the
(850/1800/1900 MHz) usually sold in the US.
 Neither the 900 MHz band 
nor
1800 MHz band are used within the US to my knowledge, so I guess my real
question is this: Since the phone does not support the 850 MHz band, 
what
is the status of 1900 MHz coverage in the area?
 Once again, 
specifically
Athens, Ohio, but I would appreciate as much information as you can give
me.

So the school is really dumb and doesn't realize that you can see your 
grades through your online dars report.  So if you do have a hold on your 
account and you want to see your grades, lol, then you can check them 
through that.  Just look at the bottom where you can see all the classes 
taken.  It was actually a nice surprise! I didn't kill my gpa, lol... fine 
fine I owe you 5 dollars, lol.  I miss you Jonathan... I always like waking 
up to your text messages.  They make my day.  I hope your day is going 
well... I'll talk to you later!

Cool news, ya'll:
OK Go posted this link (http://youtube.com/watch?v=Iu16y5N6QUI) in a bulletin 
on their Myspace page last week. They said that the 110 is one of the upcoming 
video stars of the internet! Bad news though, they think we're OSU. Dang.
Regardless, one of the artists we played from this year noticed us and enjoyed 
what we did. And now, thanks to them, many more people can enjoy us equally! I 
think that's cool so you should too.
Thanks, OK Go.

Subject: Sergio Ulloa honored by American Physical Society
Dear All,
I have happy to inform you that Professor Sergio Ulloa has just been  
named a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the primary  
professional association of physicists in the United States.  APS  
Fellowship is awarded to an elite subset of members who have made  
distinguished contributions to physics research and to the  
profession.  A maximum of one-half of one percent of the society  
members are singled out annually for this recognition.  Additional  
information can be found at http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/ 
fellowships/.
According to his citation, Sergio is being recognized "For his  
contributions to the theory of transport and optical properties of  
low-dimensional semiconductor systems and complex molecules, and his  
many contributions to international physics as organizer of schools,  
workshops, and conferences, in particular in Latin America."
Sergio is the latest in a growing number of our faculty who have  
received this highly visible recognition.  Other APS Fellows among  
current Ohio University faculty are David Drabold, Charlotte Elster,  
Steve Grimes, Kenneth Hicks, Peter Jung, M. Prakash, and Roger Rollins.
Congratulations, Sergio!
-Joe

3How to Configure Full Internet Access On BlackBerry
You are interested, if you want to do any of the following, especially if you are an individual prosumer rather than a big corporate user:
B_
#Run BES-required Internet software 
without BES
OInstant Messaging, AIM, ICQ, MSN (Verichat, WebMessenger, BerryVine, IM+, etc.)
FFull HTML web browsing ability (Reqwireless, BlackBerry Browser, etc.)
!IRC chatting (virca, wlirc, etc.)
telnet/ssh (Idokorro, etc.)
No BES needed! No MDS needed!
Easy 1-2-3 Instructions:
KA
Upgrade your BlackBerryOS
_You need BlackBerry with OS 3.8 or later. If you have an older version of BlackBerryOS, please 
'/gwt/n?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackberryforums.com%2Frim-software%2F1871-blackberryos-4-x-download-faq-upgrade-downloads.html&hl=en&q=blackberry+ssh+client&source=m&site=+
Download BlackBerryOS 4.0
) and install it on your BlackBerry first.
(Configure your BlackBerry & Your Carrier
0On the BlackBerry handheld, go to Options -> TCP
There is a new option in BlackBerryOS 3.8 and later. Then fill in APN with the provided APN listead in the below post, that is appropriate for your carrier. If no username or password is provided, leave these blank. If only a username is provided, then leave in the password. Also, ignore the Gateway IP address, unless your Blackberry specifically has a textbox to enter the IP address in. "APN" means "Access Point Name". Once you have saved the APN information, you should reboot your BlackBerry by removing and reinserting the battery.

[Once you have filled this information, your Internet applications should work on your BlackBerry. TCP/IP makes Internet software work, including chat software: Verichat, WebMessenger, IRC, Telnet/SSH, Web browsing, etc.
Occasionally, some applications on the BlackBerry need to have the gateway or APN information entered directly into them. This is not common.
/BlackBerry TCP/IP Configuration Success Reports
Nextel/Telus - iDEN 
Y0
- Has TCP/IP
DNo APN/TCP settings required on iDEN units including 65XX, 75XX and 7100i. They are special because they are iDEN and more native TCP/IP. After a new BlackBerry activation, you may need to wait 2 business days before third party Internet software such as VeriChat works. In the past, it was necessary to call Nextel to order the static IP address option (about $4/month), but now a static IP address appears to be included with BlackBerries by default.

Telus - CDMA

iRecently, in late 2005, this feature got activated on newer Telus units. Newer models including 7250 now has a TCP/IP stack, no configuration is needed.

Bell Mobility
!- Does NOT Work; Need MDS hosting
cUnfortunately, none of the Bell Mobility BlackBerries have a TCP/IP stack enabled. Not even the 7250. A future BlackBerryOS may fix this, or Bell Mobility might enable the feature in the future. No timeline known. For now, get

Sprint 
- Unknown; Might Work
Unknown. There is enough TCP/IP functionality in BlackBerryOS 4.0.0.204 or later, for software such as Verichat and Berry411 to work. This BlackBerryOS is preinstalled on the model 7250. Some software such as Reqwireless Emailviewer will require you to input gateway IP address information (See below). For the best TCP/IP support, you must use BES/MDS. You will need to pay $10 to $25 extra per month for

1Mark, you state: 'No BES needed! No MDS needed!'.
@I'm at T-Mobile Hungary and I can't get Blackberry service just yet (neither BES nor BWC) but I can get a full-blown GPRS internet plan that works perfect on my Motorola MPX200 (Web, IM, etc).
When I set the same APN/username/password and/or WAP gateway, nothing works. Tunnel can be opened (meaning, username and password are OK) but it seems to time out and I get a 'could not connect' error message. I Tried VeriChat, WebViewer, SSH apps, no go.
[How could I troubleshoot my problem and do I need to make any requests from my provider? Better asked: is there any difference how a 'normal' phone (Nokia / Motorola GPRS phones) access GPRS and how the Blackberry does?
Tx,

Yeah, gimme a second to figure out how to type it.
	k
+15133731368
Ok, so basically:  
(n + 1/2)! = sqrt(pi)*1/2*3/2*5/2... ...*(2n + 1)/2.
So for example (2.5)! = sqrt(pi)*1/2*3/2*5/2.  In (1/2)!  n=1 so it's just sqrt(pi)*1/2

That's sad =( Did you convince him otherwise, or did he just change his mind?
+15133731368
It just doesnt make sense to me
	*
+15133731368
I don't know.  Sometimes that sort of thing takes you by surprise.  Have you talked with him about it?
+15133731368
Wat sort of thing? And yes i hav, like all this morning

+15133731368

I justwanted to curl up in a corner and die... Doesnt that mean something? Would i be that hurt if i didnt feel that way about him?

+15133731368
I don't think you would be, no.  I don't know why he would think differently
+15133731368
Thank u, atleast now i dont feel like im crazy

You're not crazy, lol.  Sometimes people do things that don't make a lot of sense to everyone else.  Especially when romantic feelings are involved.

You'll be able to handle it.  You're strong.  But maybe you should let it be over now, so you don't have to be hurt again later.  Or maybe not.

+15133731368
I got it.  I think that as long as you don't mind the morning devotional, there isn't going to be a lot of religious stuff.  
5133731368
Somebody probably will ask you about your beliefs, but they're usually just curious.
+15133731368
Yeah but dont u think its strange that she didnt give me the option of not bein a part of those?
+15133731368
Maybe she just didn't think about it.  you should ask her if that's alright.  It should be, but you might enjoy hearing what other people think.
+15133731368
But i dont wana seam rude or ungreatful, cuz theyr rentin a hous and theyr agreein to let me live ther 4 free

But then i dont wana go if the main reason they want me to come is to give me a taste of their beliefs
+15133731368
Yeah, I agree.  With both things.  I'm not really sure how you should work that out.  You might try just asking. 
5133731368
 Say you're not really interested in religion, but you'd love to come along for the rest.
+15133731368
